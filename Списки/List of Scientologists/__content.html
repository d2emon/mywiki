<H1>List of Scientologists</H1></P>

<P>A Scientologist is a follower of the doctrines and beliefs of Scientology.[1] The following is an incomplete list of notable past and present Scientologists.</P>

<P>
<H2>Definition</H2></P>

<P>A Scientologist is a follower of the doctrines and beliefs of Scientology.[1] Eileen Barker writes in New Religious Movements: Challenge and Response, "the Church of Scientology considers all those who have ever done one of their courses to be a Scientologist".[2] Authors W. W. Zellner, Marc Petrowsky note in the book Sects, Cults, and Spiritual Communities: A Sociological Analysis, "Those who pay for courses are called ordinary members."[3] Writing in the 2009 book Scientology, contributor Douglas E. Cowan comments on the membership statistics put forth by the Church of Scientology: "How, though, is the concept of membership constructed in Scientology, and how is it deployed as a mechanism of legitimation? Beyond those who are active Scientologists, for example, if membership is construed as comprising every person who has ever signed up for an introductory course in auditing, attended a film presentation or lecture at an org (and left some record of their attendance), purchased Scientological materials, or taken the Oxford Capacity Analysis™ test online, then perhaps ten million is not unreasonable. It is well established in the social scientific literature that religious movements of all types—both established and new—regularly inflate membership and attendance figures, sometimes by an order of magnitude or more. That said, if few of these alleged ten million pursue their Scientological involvement no further than an initial contact, it poses the question of how devout Scientologists, in the Church hierarchy, but especially in the rank-and-file, resolve the contradiction on an ongoing basis."[4]</P>

<P>Scientology president Heber Jentzsch stated in a videotaped deposition that membership statistics for the organization are based on the sum of all individuals that have ever taken any Scientology course since the organization's foundation in 1954.[5] In a 1992 appearance on the ABC News program Nightline, Jentzsch admitted that anyone who took one course was considered a member of Scientology, "Because they joined and they came in and they studied Scientology."[6] Olav Hammer and James R. Lewis note in their book The Invention of Sacred Tradition, "the shared veneration of Hubbard becomes an integrated part of what it means to be a Scientologist".[7]</P>

Ron Hubbard.[174][173] After Scientology, Van Morrison moved on to "a broadly Christian faith".[175] He titled his 1986 album No Guru No Method as an attempt to distance himself from Scientology.[176][177] In a review of Van Morrison's musical work in The Times, journalist Pete Paphides described No Guru, No Method, No Teacher as "the 1986 album that found Morrison adrift from God, wounded by his dalliance with Scientology, wrestling the mother of spiritual hangovers and deciding that only the compass of memory could help a lost soul to redemption".[178] Van Morrison's exploration of spirituality, including Jehovah's Witness, Christianity, mysticism, and Scientology, served as an influence for his works including Astral Weeks, "Kingdom Hall", Enlightenment and "Whenever God Shines His Light".[179] In 1991, Van Morrison explained this period of spirituality and self-reflection, commenting: "I'm into all of it, orthodox or otherwise. I don't accept or reject any of it. I'm not searching for anything in particular, I'm just groping in the dark for a bit more light."[174] In 1995, when asked by the University of Ulster to list his favorite philosophers, Van Morrison included Aristotle, Socrates, Sartre, and Steiner—as well as L.
