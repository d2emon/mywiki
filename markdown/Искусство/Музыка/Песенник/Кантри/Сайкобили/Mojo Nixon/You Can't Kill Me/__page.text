!! You Can't Kill Me

You can't kill me
I will not die
Not now not ever
No never
I'm gonna live a long, long time
My soul raves on forever
Time has come
We will not wait
We storm the gates at dawn
Busting out of here
In the world
Sing our victory song
You can't kill me
I will not die
Not now not ever
No never
I'm gonna live a long, long time
My soul raves on forever
(Aim-A-Flame Johnson)
I stand alone
Out on the road
I know flesh will rot
But the renegade and crazy free
Will not forget
You can't kill me
I will not die
Not now not ever
No never
I'm gonna live a long, long time
My soul raves on forever
(Ya know, there's people out there who want to ban books
they want to ban my records
they want to tell me what I can drink
and where I can drink....
And a bunch of pissed off people
pontificating about the evils of rules and regulations
Mc Donalds, politics, etc.)
You can shoot my body full of holes
but you can't kill the spirit of rock 'n roll
