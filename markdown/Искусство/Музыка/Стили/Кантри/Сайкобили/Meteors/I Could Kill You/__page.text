!! I Could Kill You

I dont eat or sleep no more just pace around 
Banging my head on the wall just to hear the sound 
Cant hold myself together falling apart 
We used to be forever now you broke my heart 
And I could kill you for what youve done to me 

The walls are closing in its even darker than before 
Only thing I can hear is when you slammed the door 
Just how your pretty face cut me to the bone 
No rhyme or reason you left me all alone 
I could kill you for what youve done to me 
(chorus) 
Then I remember every thing weve done 
Despite myself I still love you youre the one 

Were fucked right up right now got to keep control 
dont keep on digging deeper,deeper down the hole 
My heart is fighting with the voices in my head 
I gotta let you go or well both end up dead 
I could kill you for what youve done to me 
(chorus) 
Then I remember every thing weve done 
Despite myself I still love you youre the one 
Then I remember how you made me smile 
But I remember you aint done that for a while.
