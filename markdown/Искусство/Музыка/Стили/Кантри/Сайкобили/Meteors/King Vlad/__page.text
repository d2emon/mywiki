!! King Vlad

High up in the mountains of old Carpathia 
Six hundred years ago 
He ruled his world with a vicious hand 
And he didnt fuck about oh no 
Kings and queens and mighty rulers 
Paid him tribute to stop him getting mad 
And made sure they smiled has they handed over money 
And had a drink to the good King Vlad 

With his bold army from Transylvania 
Nearly just as black heart as he 
They slaughtered all nations that would not bow to him 
It was a bloody sight to see 
Prince and paupers sons and daughters 
Show him respect or hell nail on your hat 
So give up your treasure and dont be sad 
Just have drink to the good King Vlad 

Fly the dragon flag stained in blood 
Impale people every day 
Long live the legend of this a dark king 
His memory will never go away 
All religions measured equally 
Fell to nothing and gave all they had 
So fill up your cup with the blood of his enemies 
And have a drink to the good King Vlad
