!! Sea Of Res

[@
 	Dm	Bb
 	Sta	nding on the other side
 	C	A7
 	Bu	t it's not you, it's too late to regret
 	Dm	Bb
 	At 	the end of the tunnel there's no light
 	C	A7
 	He	lp me, I'm drowning in the sea of red

Standing on the other side...

Standing on the other side...

Standing on the other side...

 	Dm
 	A thousand wounds penetrate my skin
 	Bb	A
 	Thi	s pain is unbareable, I'm about to give in
 	Dm
 	My blood is fixed with this strange kind of ink
 	Bb	A
 	Sev	eral hours of pressure - There was no time to think

Standing on the other side...

Standing on the other side...

Standing on the other side...

Standing on the other side...

Marked for life, left all alone
Out of this nightmare I suddenly was thrown
Living on an edge, colorate my skin
Am I dead or are my life about to begin

Standing on the other side...

Standing on the other side...

Standing on the other side...
