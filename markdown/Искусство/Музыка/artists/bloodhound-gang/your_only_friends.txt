MR ROGERS 
I LIKE YOUR CARDIGAN SWEATER
Mr McFeelie
Shut up and give me my letter
I don't want to talk to you
Don't you understand?
Why are you inside my house?
Your just my fuckin' mailman
I CAN GO TO THE LAND OF MAKE BELIEVE
AND I CAN PRETEND
But in the end I still have no friends

Do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do....

You are my best friend too
We hardly ever argue
Eat spam from a can
Watch late night C-Span
And rock out to old school
Duran Duran.........

That's It.
