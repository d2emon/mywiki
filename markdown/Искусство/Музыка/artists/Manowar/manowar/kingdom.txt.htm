Kingdom Come

G

G
See the white lights
G 
The light within
E
Be your own disciple
E
Fan the sparks of will
    B                 C
For all of us waiting
                  G
Your kingdom will come

G
Rays of power shining
G                   F#
Rays of magic fall
E
All the golden voice
E
That speaks within us all
    B                  C
For all of us waiting
                  G      G   A   B   B C
Your kingdom will come
        G        G   A   B   B C
Kingdom come

G ........

Fear the white lights
The light within
Yeah it burns of fire
If tries a man to win
But all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom come

Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together
While other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom come

SOLO

Kingdom coming
Now the kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
With all ...(?)
Wait and receive
The weight of the power

Ohh  
  Kingdom come
