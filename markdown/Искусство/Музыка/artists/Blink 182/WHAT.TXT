I took her out, it was a Friday night, I wore cologne,

to get the feeling right. We started making out, and

she took off my pants, but then I turned on the tv, and
		   
that's about the time

she walked away from me.

Nobody likes you when your twenty-three

And I'm still more amused by tv shows. 

What the hell is A.D.D.? My friends say I should 

act my age. What's my age again? What's my age again?

Intro

Verse 2 (Palm Mute the Chorus)

Then later on, on the drive home, I called

her mom, from a pay phone. I said "I was the cops, and

your husband's in jail. The state looks down on sodomy."

And that's about the time

Chorus

that bitch hung up on me.

Nobody likes you when you're twenty-three. 

And I'm still more amused by prank phone calls,

what the hell is caller ID? My friends say I should

act my age. What's my age again? What's my age again?

And that's about the time

Chorus

she walked away from me. Nobody likes you when

you're twenty-three. And you still act you're in

freshman year. What the hell is wrong with me?

My friends say I should act my age. What's my age again?

What's my age again?

Chorus

Thats about the time that she broke up with me.

No one should take themselves so seriously. With

many years ahead to fall in line, why would you

wish down on me? I never want to act me age. What's

my age again? What's my age again? What's my age again?

End with a B5

NOTE : At the end of some of the chorus' go from D#5 to
C#5 as opposed to going to B5, but at the end of the song
go from D#5 to C#5 to B5.
