DU HAST
(YOU HATE)  
 
You
You hate
You hate me

You
You hate
You hate me

You hate me to say
You hate me to say
You hate me to say
And I did not obey

Will you until death does sever
Be upright to her forever

Never

Will you 'til death be her rider
Her lover too, to stay inside her

Never 


ENGEL
(ANGEL)  
 
Live in virtue, no desire
In the grave an angel«s choir
You look to heaven and wonder why
No one can see them in the sky

Just as the clouds have gone to sleep
Angels can be seen in heavens keep
Alone in fear they question why
Goddamn not an angel when I die

Angels live, they never die
Apart from us , behind the sky
They ?re fading souls who ?ve turned to ice
So ashen white in paradise

Just as the clouds have gone to sleep
Angels can be seen in heaven«s keep
Alone in fear they question why
Goddamn not an angel when I die
 


KOKAIN
(COCAINE)  
 
If the friends are good to me,
the white fairy is bending her bow,
shoots into the face of my worries,
and out of the two halves
breaks the father of all mirrors.

He`s waving at me and I bend,
and he`s whispering in my ear.

You are the sweetest child of all,
I`ll keep you as my own blood, 
you are the nicest child of all,
in me, even the evil is good.


The curiosity is making my dream longer,
the white fairy, she sings and she laughs,
she made me pregnant violently,
and pregnant as I am is torturing me through the night
the father of all mirrors 

He`s waving at me and I bend,
and he`s whispering in my ear.

You are the sweetest child of all,
I`ll keep you as my own blood,
you are the nicest child of all,
in me, even the evil is good. 

And as I defend myself against
the pains of birth,
still being a bitch in the cradle,
watch me while I give birth,
and devour the own afterbirth.

You are the sweetest child of all...


SEHNSUCHT
(HUNGER)  
 
Let me ride out on a tear
Past your chin to Africa
Once more to the she-lion's den
Where I was at home back then
Inbetween your tender long legs
Searching snow from just last year
Never does the snow appear

Let me ride out on a tear
In the clouds there is no bliss
A big bird gently slides his head
Back into a secret crevice
Inbetween your tender long legs
Searching sand from just last year
Never does the sand appear


Hunger connects
Just like an insect
Asleep you never sense
Right as it bites
Nowhere can it be good so
The finger slips to Mexico
Then down it sinks into the sea
Hunger has no mercy


BESTRAFE MICH
(PUNISH ME)  
 
Punish me 
Punish me
Straw is gold
And gold is stone
You are so big, make me small
You?re the master,
make me crawl
ja

The lord does give
The lord does take


Punish me
Punish me
You say yes
And I say no
Lock me in all you worship
Before the winds cold hand grips

You are so big, make me small
Your the master, make me crawl
Your the master, make me crawl


You are so big, make me small
Your the master, make me crawl
You?re so big you make him small
You will punish me for all
The lord does give
The lord does take
Does he give love to
Those he foresakes?
Punish me
 

SPIEL MIT MIR
(PLAY WITH ME)  
 
We share a room and the bed
Brother dear please go right ahead
Brother dear come touch me here
Slide to me so close and near

By the bed a big black hole
In they jump all the sheep
Much too old but I count them still
But I cannot fall asleep

Past my navel in the bush
Waiting there white fantasies
Brother dear come hold me tight
And shake for me leaves from the trees


Play a game with me
Give me your hand and

Play with me - A game
Play with me - A game
Play with me - Cause we?re alone now
Play with me - A game
Father mother child

My brother dear hand in pain
He rolls back over once again
My brother helps me now and then
So that I may sleep again


Play a game with me
Give me your hand and

Play with me - A game
Play with me - A game
Play with me - Cause we?re alone now
Play with me - A game
Father mother child 



ALTER MANN
(THE OLD MAN)  
 
He's waiting for the midday wind
And waves spread out so dull and slack
And with a hand fan every day
The old man smooths the water back

I cast a stone in just for fun
The water rings moved on the plane
So sadly stood the old man by
And swept the water flat again

In white sand the old man sat
Trembling as he smoked his pipe
Just the water and I know that
The fan is of a special type

Awareness sleeps volcano dreams
Reluctant I asked him why
His head hung low as if he slept
And the he said before he died


The water will be your only mirror
First when it's like glass can you see
How many fairytales you have left
For your deliverance you will plead


The fan was pressed to his breast
Just as death's grip seized up his hand
His fingers must have been so tight
The fan remained back in the sand

I call the old man every day
Should he come and deliver me
I stay here with the midday wind
And in the fan it is plain to read

The water will... 



EIFERSUCHT
(JEALOUSY)  
 
Am I pretty
Then cut me in the face
Am I stronger
Break my neck in disgrace
Am I smarter
Kill me and eat my brain
I take your wife
Kill me and eat me all up
Just eat me all up

Am I honest
Then bite my tongue right off
Am I richer
Then take it all
Am I braver
Kill me and eat my heart
I take your wife
Kill me and eat me all up
Just eat me all up
And lick the table clean


We're cooking jealousy

Have I such tender skin
Tear it out in stripes
Have i the clearest eyes
Steal all the light
Have I the purest soul
Burn it in the flames
I take your wife then
Kill me and eat me all up
Just eat me all up

And lick the table clean

We're cooking jealousy
