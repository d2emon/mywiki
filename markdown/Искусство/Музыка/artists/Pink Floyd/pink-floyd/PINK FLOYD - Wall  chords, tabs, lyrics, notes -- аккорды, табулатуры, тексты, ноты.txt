# When the Tigers Broke Free
# --------------------------
#
#         C                    Gsus                C
# It was just before dawn one miserable morning in black forty-four
#
# C
# When the foreward commander was told to sit tight,
#
#                          F/C        C
# When they asked that his men be withdrawn
#
# C
# And the generals gave thanks, as the other ranks
#
# Gsus                 C
# Held back the enemy tanks for a while
#
#         C                    Gsus
# And the Anzio Bridgehead was held for the price
#
#      C
# Of a few hundred ordinary lives
#
#
#
# C                 G                    C                       G
# And kind old King George sent Mother a note when he heard that Father  
was gone
#
# C           G                      C
# It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll with gold leaf and all
#
# C
# And I found it one day in a drawer of old photographs hidden away
#
# C                                Gsus
# And my eyes still grow damp to remember
#
#             C
# His Majesty signed with his own rubber stamp
#
# C                G                             C
# It was dark all around, there was frost on the ground
#
#                       G
# When the Tigers broke free
#
# C
# And no-one survived from the Royal Fusiliers, Company "C"
#
# G                    C                   G                         C
# They were all left behind,  most of them dead  -  the rest of them dying
#
# C                  G                    C
# And that's how the high command took my daddy from me
#
#
# In The Flesh ?

# What Shall We Do Now ?  (Empty Spaces has no chords, just bass.
# ---- ----- -- -- --- -   I don't have the chords to What Shall ...)

# What shall we use to fill the empty spaces
# Where waves of hunger roar
# Shall we set out across this sea of faces
# In search of more and more applause
# Shall we buy a new guitar
# Shall we drive a more powerful car
# Shall we work straight - through the night
# Shall we get into fights
# Leave the lights on
# Drop bombs
# Do tours of the East
# Contract diseases
# Bury bones
# Break up homes
# Send flowers by phone
# Take to drink
# Go to shrinks
# Give up meat
# Rarely sleep
# Keep people as pets
# Train dogs
# Race rats
# Fill the attic with cash
# Bury treasure
# Store up leisure
# But never relax at all
# With out backs to the wall
