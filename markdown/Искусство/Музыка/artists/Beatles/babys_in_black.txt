     Baby's in Black     Lennon / McCartney     (1964)

{Waltz}
{Chorus:}
       [F]Oh dear, [C7]what can I do, 
       [Bb7]Baby's in black and [C7]I'm feeling blue, 
       Tell me [F]oh, [Bb7]what can I [F]do [C7].

1. [F]She thinks of him and [F7]so she dresses in [Bb]black
And though he'll never come [F]back, [C7]she's dressed in [F]black.

       {Chorus.}

2. I think of her, but she thinks only of him,
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him.

{Middle:}
[Dmi]Oh, how [G7]long will it take, [Bb]till she [C7]sees the mistake
she has [F]made, dear, [C7]what can I do, 
[Bb7]Baby's in black and [C7]I'm feeling blue, 
Tell me [F]oh, [Bb7]what can I [F]do [C7].

{repeat verse 1 & Chorus, ending [Bb] [F] instead of [C7].}
