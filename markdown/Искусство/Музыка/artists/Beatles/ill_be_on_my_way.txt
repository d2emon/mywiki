                      The Beatles
                    "Live At The BBC"

     A             E
The sun is fading away
  A                    D
That's the end of the day.
A
As the june light
E7
Turns to moon light
A       D      A    E7
I'll be on my way.


Just one kiss and I'll go

Don't hide the tears that don't show.

A
As the june light
E7
Turns to moon light
A       D      A    E7
I'll be on my way.

     B                     E
To where the winds don't blow
      B               B
And northern rivers flow
 F#7      B      E7
This way will I go.

  A                      E7
They where right I was wrong
  A                    D
True love didn't last long.
A
As the june light
 E7
Turns to moon light
A       D      A    E7
I'll be on my way.


 A
I'll  Be on my way



        That's it !

Here are the chords to my favorite off of the recent Beatles At The BBC
release.  I think I've got all the lyrics right -- corrections on that
front would be greatly appreciated.


  I'LL BE ON MY WAY  by John Lennon and Paul McCartney


  [A/E] [A/F] [A/F#] [A/F]

The [A] sun is fading a[E]way;
[A] That's the end of the [D] day.
[A] As the June light [E] turns to moonlight,
[A] I'll be [D] on my [A] way. [E]

[A] Just one kiss and I'll [E] go.
Don't [A] hide the tears that don't [D] show.
[A] As the June light [E] turns to moonlight,
[A] I'll be [D] on my [A] way. [E]

  To [B] where the winds don't [E] blow
  And [B] golden rivers [E] flow;
  [F#] This way will I [B] go.

[A] They were right, I was [E] wrong;
[A] True love didn't last [D] long.
[A] As the June light [E] turns to moonlight,
[A] I'll be [D] on my [A] way. [E]
