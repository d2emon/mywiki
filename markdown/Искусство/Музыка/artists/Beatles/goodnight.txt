Goodnight      Lennon / McCartney      (1968)

{Slow lullaby}
1. [G]Now it's [Bmi]time to [C]say goodnight,
[Bmi]Good [C]night, sleep [D7]tight.
[G]Now the [Bmi]sun turns [C] out his light,
[Bmi]Good [C]night, sleep [D7] tight

{Chorus:}
         [Bmi]Dream sweet [Ami]dreams for [Bmi]me [Ami],
         [G]Dream sweet [Ami]dreams for [G]you [Ami].

2. Close your eyes and I'll close mine,  Goodnight, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine,   Goodnight, sleep tight

{Chorus.}

{Middle:}
         [G]Hm, m [Ami]m, [A]Hm, m [Dmi]m, [G]Hm, m, [C]m-m-m [D7]m.

3. Close your eyes and I'll close mine,   Goodnight, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light,   Goodnight, sleep tight

{Chorus.}
