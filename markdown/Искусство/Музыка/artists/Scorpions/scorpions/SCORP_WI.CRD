[Intro:] F, Dm, F, Dm, Am7, Dm Am7, G

C                Dm
 I follow the Moskva
               C
 Down to Gorky Park
                  Dm      Am7  G
 Listening to the wind of change
C                 Dm
 An August summer night
                  C
 Soldiers passing by
                  Dm      Am7  G
 Listening to the wind of change

[Interlude:]  F9, Dm, F, Dm, Am7, Dm Am7, G

C                     Dm
 The world is closing in
              C
 Did you ever think
                     Dm          Am7    G
 That we could be so close, like brothers
C                    Dm
 The future's in the air
                    C
 I can feel it everywhere
                  Dm      Am7  G
 Blowing with the wind of change

[Chorus:]

   C     G         Dm           G
    Take me to the magic of the moment
         C     G
    On a glory night
              Dm            G             Am
    Where the children of tomorrow dream away
   Am/F            G
    In the wind of change

C                 Dm
 Walking down the street
             C
 Distant memories
                   Dm      Am7 G
 Are buried in the past forever




C                Dm
 I follow the Moskva
               C
 Down to Gorky Park
                  Dm      Am7  G
 Listening to the wind of change


   C     G         Dm           G
    Take me to the magic of the moment
         C     G
    On a glory night
              Dm            G                  Am
    Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
   Am/F          G
    With you and me


   C     G         Dm           G
    Take me to the magic of the moment
         C     G
    On a glory night
              Dm            G             Am
    Where the children of tomorrow dream away
   Am/F            G
    In the wind of change


Am                        G
 The wind of change blows straight
                  Am
 Into the face of time
                            G
 Like a stormwind that will ring
                               C
 The freedom bell for peace of mind
                    Dm
 Let your balalaika sing
                         E     E
 What my guitar wants to say

[SOLO:]  F G, E Am, F G, Am,
         F G, E7 Am, Dm, E


   C     G         Dm           G
    Take me to the magic of the moment
         C     G
    On a glory night
              Dm            G                  Am
    Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
   Am/F          G
    With you and me


   C     G         Dm           G
    Take me to the magic of the moment
         C     G
    On a glory night
              Dm            G             Am
    Where the children of tomorrow dream away
   Am/F            G
    In the wind of change
