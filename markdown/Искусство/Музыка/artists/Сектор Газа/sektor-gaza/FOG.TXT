Album: Gas Attack
Song: The Fog. (Lyrics by Bakhvalov Anton A.)

Everything was fine!
Sun was brightly shinin'
But the wind raised up the dangerous smoke!
Fire of the Sun
And the atmosphere
Overcame, but could not nasty fog.

And only dead Moon is enlighting our way!
And crazy stars give us nightmare and dismay!
And everything is not OK,
And our way is very long,
And there's no simple way to pass the fog!

There's no place to step!
We don't have a map!
And the God will be our only guide!
We feel only pain!
Once began the rain!
It will try to kill all our pride!

And fucken Moon will try to make us to give up!
And parspirations of the swamp are coming up!
And our wounds are filled with blood
And our hearts are not so strong!
And there's no simple way to pass the fog!

We understood a lot!
Life is very shot!
It is shot and isn't very long!
After so much loss
We shall kiss the cross!
And will try to step into the fog!

Though only dead Moon is enlighting our way!
Though crazy stars give us nightmare and dismay!
Though everything is not OK,
And our way is very long,
But we shall pass the dangerous path against the fog!
Though fucken Moon will try to make us to give up!
Though parspirations of the swamp are coming up!
Though our wounds are filled with blood
Though our hearts are not so strong!
But you and I will pass the way against the fog!
But you and I will pass the way against the fog!
But we shall pass the dangerous path against the fog!
