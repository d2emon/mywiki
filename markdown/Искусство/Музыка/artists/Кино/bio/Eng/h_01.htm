To install RMG Player in your PC run install.exe file from root directory of the disk.
After that any MP3-disk of RMG company will run automatically as soon as you insert it into your CD-Rom. <p>

As RMG Player uses WinAmp (Nullsoft, Inc. ("Nullsoft")) to play MP3 files, you will be suggested to install it in your PC.<p>

You can update WinAmp in <a href="http://www.winamp.com"  target="_blank">"Nullsoft"</a> company site.<p>

You can start RMG Player directly from root catalogue of your disk with the help of start.exe file, but in this case you lose the 
opportunity to save your adjustments both for RMG Player and WinAmp.<p>

RMG Player gives following opportunities:<br>
- looking through videos and printed output of photos and songs' texts;<br>
- printed output of disk content in any style and sequence with specifying of 
  track numbers (very useful for listening trough our disks on 
  hardware MP3 players and quick search of needed track);<br>
- listening to the tracks in any sequence, making the list of "favorites" for each of our disks;<p>

You can switch off RMG Player and use only WinAmp if you like.<p>

If your WinAmp doesn't display Russian notes correctly, do the following:<br>
-	right click mouse in bottom right corner of primary WinAmp window;<br>
-	chose "Options", "Preferences" from the appeared menu;<br>
-	in the showed-up  "WinAmp Preferences"  window chose "Options", "Display" on the left;
uncheck the string "Use bitmap font for main title display (no int. support)" in the list on the right.<br>
