D
I would do anything
A
And that's what scares me so bad
hE
Don't want to live my life alone
G
Don't want to go back to what I had
D
Dont' want to spend my life without
A
All these special things
hE
Don't want to walk around
G
Being tied to anyone else's strings

C                   hF
Striiiiiiiiiiings strings
C                   hF
Striiiiiiiiiiings strings
