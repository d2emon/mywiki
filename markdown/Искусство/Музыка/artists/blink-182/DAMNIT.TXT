Blink 182, Damnit
James, Dave3641@aol.com
Alright, I just saw a blink tab on this site, and it is pretty much garbage.  There aren't too many good tabs out there, even though this site is probably the best.  There are a lot of people out there that are like, "I was too lazy to finish it, so play it like this", and i know you guys read that, and are like, "what the Fuck?"
So here is the good tab of Damnit.....
Any questions or comments feel free to email me any time at Davem3641@aol.com

               REPEAT THIS PRETTY MUCH THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SONG AND HAVE YOUR DISTORTION TURNED PRETTY HIGH UP, CAUSE IT DOESN't SOUND AS GOOD WITHOU IT.

THEN AFTER THAT ALL YOU DO IS JUST PLAY THAT LINE WITHOUT THE MUTING, AND YOU JUST PLAY THE POWER CHORD.
NOT HARD AT ALL!!!
CHECK OUT ALL THE RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE STUFF, AND IF YOU HAVE ANY NEW TABS FROM THE BATTLE OF LOS ANGLELES CD, SEND THEM TO ME CAUSE I TABBED THIS FOR YOU!!!
