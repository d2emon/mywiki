G                                                    F
I was alone I took a ride I didn't know what I would find  there
G                                                  F
Another road where maybe I can see another kind of mind there
Bm    Bb+      D/A    G#m7
Ooh   then I suddenly see you
Bm    Bb+        D/A    G#m7 
Ooh   did I tell you I  need you
C      C/B     Am7  D      G
Every  single  day  of  my life



You didn't run you didn't lie you I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone you'd knew in time we meet again for I'd have told you
Ooh you were meant to be near me
And I want you hear me
Say we'll be together every day

G                      C
Got to get you into my life

G--------------------------------  (repeat this twice after "Got to
D--------------------------------   get you into my life")
A--------------------------------
E--------------------------------

What can I do? What can I be when I'm with you I wanna stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave and if I do I know the way there
Ooh then I suddenly see you
Ooh did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Got to get you into my life

(repeat 1st verse with a slightly different sound to the vocals)
