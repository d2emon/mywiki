	One After Nine-Oh-Nine
	(Lennon-McCartney)


Verse:
    B
My baby said she's traveling on the one after nine oh nine

I said move over honey  I'm traveling on that line

I said move over once  move over twice
  E
C'mon baby don't be cold as ice
 B                        F#7                B
Said she's traveling on the one after nine oh nine


Verse:
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
I Said you're only fooling round  only fooling round with me
I said move over once  move over twice
C'mon baby don't be cold as ice
Said I'm traveling on the one after nine oh nine


Middle:
  E                  B
Picked up the bags    Run to the station
 C#                          F#
Rail man said   You got the wrong location
  E                    B
Picked up the bags    Run right home
 C#                      F#7
Then I find   I got the number wrong    well

Verse:
Said she's traveling on the one after nine oh nine
I said move over honey  I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once  move over twice
C'mon baby don't be cold as ice
Said I'm traveling on the one after nine oh nine
