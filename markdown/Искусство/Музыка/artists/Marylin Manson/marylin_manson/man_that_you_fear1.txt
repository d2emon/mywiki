Ok, here are the chords for the song.In the
first part of the song there is no guitar to
speak of but I found I could play along with
the cd and it sounded pretty close.  Use
lots of distortion but just strum the strings
lightly thru the verses and heavier in
the chorus.
I will just post the chords I used and I
suggest you listen to the cd for the timing
and stuff.  Its pretty easy...
 
 
Chords used - Just use standard tuning.

Verse 1.
 
G5
the ants are in the sugar
Bb5                 C5
the muscles atrophied
                    A5
we're on the other side,
                            G5
the screen is us and we're t.v.
              Bb5
spread me open,
                       C5
sticking to my pointy ribs
                         A5
are all your infants in abortion cribs
G5                 Bb5
I was born into this
                     C5
everything turns to shit
                              A5
the boy that you loved is the man that you fear

pray until your number,

asleep from all your pain,

your apple has been rotting

tomorrow's turned up dead

G5         Bb5                         C5
i have it all and i have no choice but to
                           A5
i'll make everyone pay and you will see
G5                     Bb5
you can kill yourself now
                           C5
because you're dead in my mind

the boy that you loved is the monster you fear

E5                           B5
peel off all those eyes and crawl into the dark,
       C5
you've poisoned all of your children to camouflage your scars
E5                        B5
pray unto the splinters, pray unto your fear
C5
pray your life was just a dream the cut that never heals
E5             B5
   pray now baby, pray your life was just a dream
C5                           C5

pinch the head off, collapse me like a weed
               A
someone had to go this far
G                Bb
I was born into this
                    C5  (distortion kicks in here)
everything turns to shit
                              A5
the boy that you loved is the man that you fear
 
 
Chorus 2.

the world in my hands, there's no one left to hear you scream
 
there's no one left for you
 
End with lotsa distortion.
