drop d-tuning. there is a ringing noise behind the chorus riff and I 
cant make out if its a guitar or keyboard so i will try to figure which 
one it is.

riff 1 (intro #1: that last chord is my best guess. the <5>'s are 
harmonics)
e||---------------------------------------------||
B||---------------------------------------------||
G||---------------------------------------------||
D||------------------------------------------6--||
A||--<5><5><5><5><5><5><5><5><5><5><5><5><5>-x--||
D||------------------------------------------6--||


riff 2 (intro #2: major distortion)
e||----------------------------------------------------------------||
G||----------------------------------------------------------8^10--||
B||--8-----7-----8-----7-----5---7---8-----7-----8-----7-----x-----||
D||--8-0-0-7-0-0-8-0-0-7-0-0-5-0-7-0-8-0-0-7-0-0-8-0-0-7-0-0-5^7---||
A||--6-0-0-5-0-0-6-0-0-5-0-0-3-0-5-0-6-0-0-5-0-0-6-0-0-5-0-0-------||
D||----0-0---0-0---0-0---0-0---0---0---0-0---0-0---0-0---0-0-------||


riff 3 (this is in the background after the second intro and is a fill 
at odd times)
e||-----------------------||
B||-----------------8^10--||
G||--7--------------x-----||
D||--7----6----5----5^7---||
A||--5----6----5----------||
D||-------6----5----------||


riff 4 (this is also a fill that is done at weird times and is hard to 
distinguish from this riff and riff 4 because it is so much in the 
background of the song. you can hear this when marilyn is saying "i'll 
suffer for you". I cant tell if whoever is playing guitar is bending up 
and down or hammering on and pulling off on that middle part but it 
sounds mor like a bend)
e||----------------------------||
B||----------------------8^10--||
G||--7-7-7---------------x-----||
D||--7-7-7---5^6^5--3----5^7---||
A||--5-5-5---5^6^5--3----------||
D||----------5^6^5--3----------||


riff 5 (chorus riff: there are subtle differences so I'll show the 
entire chorus riff. ^^^^ = progressively bend up half a step, **** = 
progressively bend back down to the riff written)

Here are the lyrics which I got from http://www.marilyn-manson.net

Your mouth is like a suicide
   Talkin like you never died
   Automatic charisma
   For your chemical mind
   I'll suffer for you
   I'll suffer for you 
   You're kissing me like benzocaine with your sleeping pill eyes
   Melting me down and suck suck sucking my brain
   I'm gonna hate you tomorrow
   Because you make me hate you today
   I'm gonna hate you tomorrow
   Because you make me hate you today
   I can be the one that you believe in
   I can be the liar in your bed
   I'll be the suck for your solution
   Tell me that your sex isn't dead
   Dead
   Your sex is dead
   I've suffered for you
   I've suffered for you
   I've suffered for you since the day I was made
   I've suffered for you
   I've suffered for you
   I've suffered for you since the day I was made
   I am the center of your hate
   I'm gonna be you tomorrow
   Because you make me hate you today
   I can be the one that you believe in
   I can be the liar in your bed
   I'll be the suck for your solution
   Tell me that your sex isn't dead
   Dead
   your sex is dead
   All so tired
   Desexed and jaded
   Hopeless and souless and bored of the thrill
   We make our death/sex/symbol
   When we can't fuck then we kill
   Dead
   I've suffered for you
   I've suffered for you
   I've suffered for you since the day I was made
   I've suffered for you
   I've suffered for you
   I've suffered for you since the day I was made
   (chorus)
