<html>irresponsible hate anthem 
(recorded live Febuary 14, 1997)
by marilyn manson
from the album AntiChrist Superstar
tabbed by Andrew Cogswell <v7b39@unb.ca>

This song is really fast and fun to play at weddings 
and barmitzfahs and stuff.  It is played in standard 
tuning with all power chords, and the bass just 
follows the guitar.  Have fun.

 [Intro] noise and stuff

 [Main/Chorus Riff]

 [Verse 1]
==feedback==
I am so all-American, I'd sell you suicide
I am totalitarian, I've got abortions in my eyes
A5    A5    A5    A5    A5    A5    A5    A5
I hate the hater, I rape the raper
I am the animal who will not be himself

 [Chorus]
Fuck it!

 [Verse 2]
==bass only playing Main/Chorus Riff==
Hey victim should I black your eyes again?
Hey victim you were the one who put the stick in my 
hand
A5    A5    A5    A5    A5    A5    A5    A5
I am the ism, my hate's a prism
Let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them out

 [Chorus]
Fuck it!

 [Interlude]
Everybody's someone else's nigger 
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side

 [Lead Riff] x2

==Bass Only playing Interlude Riff==
I better better better better not say this
Better better better better not tell
A5    A5    A5    A5    A5    A5    A5    A5
I hate the hater, I rape the raper
I am the idiot who will not be himself

 [Chorus]
Fuck it!

 [Interlude]
Everybody's someone else's nigger 
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side

 [Lead Riff]
America cannot save everything
America cannot save anything
History was written by hate

 [Chorus]

 [Interlude] step up the drums to 1/2 time
Everybody's someone else's nigger 
I know you are, so am I
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers
I don't need to choose a side

 [Outro]

 [End then roll on into "the beautiful people*"]
