those fancy little dots at the A-string just mean to go to the 10th fret. I
didn't feel like crowding a whole bunch of numbers together...

Here you go... along with this submition (this being my first) I am making a
few others. I was bored I was listening to Marilyn Manson's latest album,
Antichrist Superstar, I picked up my guitar, and half of the songs' music
came at me like greased lightning. I am now giving you a special gift by
sharing these with you... (be happy or I'll chop out your knee caps)

didn't feel like crowding a whole bunch of numbers together so I did that
