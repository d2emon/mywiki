<html>		    SWEET DREAMS (ARE MADE OF THIS)
		      AS PLAYED BY MARILYN MANSON
				
			     by Steve Long


Here is the main riff with the rhythm chords played behind it:

  C               G#      G
E---------------------------------
B---------------------------------
G---------------------------------
D-----5---6---5-------------------
A-3-3---3---3---3-----6/8-----5/6-
E-----------------4-4-----3-3-----

Then he plays something like this, sorta like a chorus:

G# G# G# G# G# G# G# G# 
G# G# G# G# G# G# G G 
A A A A A A A A
G# G# G# G# G# G# G#G 
G# G# G# G# G# G# G# G# 
G G G G G G G G A

The solo parts I couldn't figure out, but if you know them have fun!!
