The Man That You Fear
         by
   Marilyn Manson


[1st Verse-no guitar]

Ants are in the sugar/Muscles atrophied/We're on the other side (the screen 
is us and we're TV)/Spread me open, sticking to my pointy ribs are all your 
infants in abortion cribs/I was born into this/Everything turns to shit/The 
boy that you loved is the man that you fear.

[1st Chorus-no guitar]

Pray until your number/Asleep from all your pain/Your apple has been 
rotting/Tomorrow's turned up dead


Now we're far in enough to give you the verse riff:

The chord symbols given are not the exact symbols for the chords, I'm 
just using those as a symbol to show when each part of the riff
is started during the verse.


2nd Verse-

G                B
   I have it all and I have no choice but 

G                              A
to. I'll make everyone pay and you will see

G                        B  
   You can kill yourself now because you're dead in my 

G                                   A
mind. The boy that you loved is the monster you fear

Chorus:

E                      D
Peel off all thos eyes/Crawl into the dark

    B                           A 
You poison all your children to camouflage your scars

E                        D
Pray unto your splinters/Pray unto your fears

B                                   A
Pray your life was just a dream/The cut that never heals

E                 D                     B         A 
    Pray now, baby/Pray your life was just dream  (Just a dream...)


[3rd Chorus extension]

    E                             D
The world in my hands and there's no one left to

 B              A
hear you scream/No one left for you

I'm sure you're thoroughly upset that I didn't give the 3rd verse's 
stucture but the guitar's much easier to hear there so I'm done.
