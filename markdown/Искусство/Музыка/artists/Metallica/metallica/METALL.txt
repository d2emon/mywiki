 Told me when I was young 
 Son your life's an open book 
 Don't close it before it's done 
 The brigh test flame burns quickest 
 Thats what I heard her say 
 The son's heart's owed to mother 
 But I must find my way 
 Let my heart go 
 Let your son grow 
 Mama let my heart go 
 Mama let this heart be still 
 
 Remember my new last name 
 Wild blood in my veins 
 Draping the strings around my neck 
 The mark that still remains 
 Left home at an early age 
 of what I heard was wrong 
 I never asked forgiveness 
 For what is said is done 
 Let my heart go 
 Let your son grow 
 Mama let my heart go 
 Mama let this heart be still 
 
 Never I asked of you 
 but never I gave 
 But you gave me your emptiness 
 that I'll take to my grave 
 Never I asked of you 
 but never I gave 
 But you gave me your emptiness 
 that I'll take to my grave 
 So let this heart be still 
 Mama now I'm coming home 
 I'm not all you wished of me 
 A mother's love for her son 
 was spoken heavily 
 yeah I took your love for granted 
 and all the things you said to me 
 I need your arms to welcome me 
 That cold stone's all I see 
 Let my heart go 
 Let your son grow 
 Mama let my heart go 
 Mama let this heart be still 
 Let my heart go 
 Let your son grow 
 Mama let my heart go 
 Mama let this heart be still

 Never I asked of you

 But you gave me your emptiness

 So let this heart be still
