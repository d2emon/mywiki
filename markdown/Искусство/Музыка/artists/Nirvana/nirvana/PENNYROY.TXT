Music and words by Kurt Cobain


Tune down 1/2-step:  Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb



Am                 G
Im on my time with everyone

Am              G
I have very bad posture

C             D          A# 
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea

C                D               A#
Distill the life thats inside of me

C             D          A#
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea

C     D   A#
Im anemic royalty


Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld
So I can sigh eternally

Im so tired I cant sleep
Im a liar and a thief
Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea
Im anemic royalty

Im on warm milk and laxatives
Cherry-flavored antacids

(End on Am)
