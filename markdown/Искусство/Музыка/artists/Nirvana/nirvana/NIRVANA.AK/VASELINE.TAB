Subject: TAB: "Vaseline Cover Songs" by Nirvana

I've decided to list all three of the Vaseline cover songs Nirvana has done,
since they're all real short (Molly's Lips, Son of a Gun, and Jesus Wants Me
For A Sunbeam).  (a chord notation is at the end of this document for the
musically retarded)

*Molly's Lips*
This is just two chords throughout.  Just G5  C5.  That's it!

*Son of a Gun*
The intro and verse is A5  E5  D5  E5
Chorus: G5  C5  D5  C5
The interlude is just basically  G5  D5  a couple of times, then  A5  E5* a
couple of times, then back to  G5  D5  four times.

*Jesus Wants Me For a Sunbeam*
Verse: E5  D5  A5
Chorus:  E5  D5  E5  D5  E5  D5  A5
The solo (and the accordion part in the Unplugged version, I think) goes like
this:

----------------------------------------------------------
-----------------9-7--------------------------------------
--6-7-8-9--9-9------9-7--7-7--9-7-6---------7-6---------
--------------------------------------7--7-7------7--7-7-
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------

In live versions, the first and third verse are clean, while the choruses,
second verse, and solo are distorted.  But both live electric versions and
the acoustic Unplugged version are played this way.  On Unplugged it's tuned
down 1/2 step and for the outro the above tab is played once and then this is
played:

--------------------------------------------
-----------------9-7-------------7--9--10--
--6-7-8-9--9-9------9-7--7-7--9-----------
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------
