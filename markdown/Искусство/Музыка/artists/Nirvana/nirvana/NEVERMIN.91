@SONG: Smells Like Teen Spirit


Load up on guns and
Bring your friends
It's fun to lose
And to pretend
She's over bored
And self assured
Oh no, I know
A dirty word

hello, how low? (x bunch of times)

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now
Entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now
Entertain us
A mulatto
An albino
A mosquito
My Libido
Yeah

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

hello, how low? (x bunch of times)

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now
Entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now
Entertain us
A mulatto
An albino
A mosquito
My Libido
Yeah

And I forget
Just why I taste
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
I found it hard
It was hard to find
Oh well, whatever, nevermind

hello, how low? (x bunch of times)

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now
Entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now
Entertain us
A mulatto
An albino
A mosquito
My Libido
Yeah, a denial
A denial
A denial...


@SONG: In Bloom


Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands

He's the one
Who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean
Knows not what it mean
And I say
He's the one
Who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean
Knows not what it mean
And I say yeah

We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom

He's the one
Who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean
Knows not what it mean
And I say
He's the one
Who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean
Knows not what it mean
And I say yeah

He's the one
Who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean
Knows not what it mean
And I say
He's the one
Who likes all the pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it mean
Knows not what it mean
And I say yeah


@SONG: Come As You Are


Come
As you are
As you were
As I want you to be
As a friend

As an old enemy
Take your time
Hurry up
The Choice is your
Dont' be late
Take a rest
As a friend
As an old memoria
memoria

Come
Dowsed in mud
Soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend
A a friend
As an old memoria
memoria
memoria

And I swear
That I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun

memoria

And I swear
That I don't have a gun
No I don't have a gun

No i don't have a gun

@SONG: Breed


I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Care if I'm old

I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
mind
Don't have a mind

Get way
Get way
Get way
Get way
Get way
Way from your home

I'm afraid
I'm afraid
I'm afraid
I'm afraid
Fraid, of a ghost

Even if you have
Even if you need
I don't mean to stare
We don't have to breed
We can plant a house
We can build a tree
I don't even care
We could have all three

She said  (X 8)


@SONG: Lithium


I'm so happy
Cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly
But that's ok, 'cause so are you
We've broke our mirrors
Sunday morning
Is everyday for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles
In a daze 'cause I've found god

Yeah  (x bunch of times)

I'm so lonely and
That's ok, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe
I'm to blame for all I've heard
And I'm not sure
I'm so excited
I can't wait to meet you there
And I dont' care
I'm so horny but
That's ok, my will is good

Yeah (x bunch of times)

I like it
I'm not gonna crack
I miss you
I'm not gonna crack
I love you
I'm not gonna crack
I killed you
I'm not gonna crack
I like it
I'm not gonna crack
I miss you
I'm not gonna crack
I love you
I'm not gonna crack
I killed you
I'm not gonna crack

I'm so happy
Cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly
But that's ok, 'cause so are you
We've broke our mirrors
Sunday morning
Is everyday for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles
In a daze 'cause I've found god

Yeah  (x bunch of times)

I like it
I'm not gonna crack
I miss you
I'm not gonna crack
I love you
I'm not gonna crack
I killed you
I'm not gonna crack
I like it
I'm not gonna crack
I miss you
I'm not gonna crack
I love you
I'm not gonna crack
I killed you
I'm not gonna crack


@SONG: Polly


Polly wants a cracker
Think I should get off of her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

It isn't me
We have some seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Don't hurt yourself
I want some help
To help myself
I've got some rope
You have been told
I promise you
I have been true
Let me take a ride
Don't hurt yourself
I want some help
To help myself

Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like more food
She asks me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

It isn't me
We have some seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Don't hurt yourself
I want some help
To help myself
I've got some rope
You have been told
I promise you
I have been true
Let me take a ride
Don't hurt yourself
I want some help
To help myself

{Polly said}
Polly says her back hurts
And she's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
It amazes me, the will of instinct

It isn't me
We have some seed
Let me clip
Your dirty wings
Let me take a ride
Don't hurt yourself
I want some help
To help myself
I've got some rope
You have been told
I promise you
I have been true
Let me take a ride
Don't hurt yourself
I want some help
To help myself


@SONG: Territorial Pissings


{intro thing}

When I was an alien
Cultures weren't opinions

Gotta find a way
To find a way
When I'm there
Gotta find a way
A better way
I had better wait

Never met a wise man
If so it's a woman

Gotta find a way
To find a way
When I'm there
Gotta find a way
A better way
I had better wait
Gotta find a way
To find a way
When I'm there
Gotta find a way
A better way
I had better wait

Just because you're paranoid
Don't mean they're not after you

Gotta find a way
To find a way
When I'm there
Gotta find a way
A better way
Gotta find a way
To find a way
When I'm there
Gotta find a way
A better way
I had better wait
Gotta find a way
To find a way
When I'm there
Gotta find a way
A better way
I had better wait
Gotta find a way
To find a way
When I'm there
Gotta find a way
A better way
I had better wait


@SONG: Drain You


One baby to another says
I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think unless
It is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
A travel through a tube and end up in your infection

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
'cause I like you

With eyes so dilated
I've became your pupil
You've taught me everything
Without a poison apple
The water is so yellow
I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful
Vacuum out the fluids

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
'cause I like you
You
You
You
You
You

One baby to another says
I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think unless
It is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
A travel through a tube and end up in your infection

Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
Sloppy it lips to lips
You're my vitamins
'cause I'm like you


@SONG: Lounge Act


Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it wouldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you

Don't, tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowning fear
Experience anything yoy need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone

I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you

Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it wouldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing

I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To make you a deal
We've make a pact
To learn from who
Ever we want
Without new rules
We'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way
To prove they still
Smell her on you
They still, smell her on you
Smell her on you


@SONG: Stay Away


Monkey See, monkey do
{I don't know why}
I'd rather be deal than cool
{I don't know why}
Every line ends in rhyme
{I don't know why}
Less is more, love is blind
{I don't know why}

Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away

Give an inch, take a smile
{I don't know why}
Fashion shits, fashion stile
{I don't know why}
Throw it out and keep it in
{I don't know why}
Have to have poison skin
{I don't know why}

Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away

I don't know why
I don't know why

Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away

Monkey See, monkey do
{I don't know why}
I'd rather be deal than cool
{I don't know why}
Every line ends in rhyme
{I don't know why}
Less is more, love is blind
{I don't know why}

Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away

I don't know why
I don't know why

Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away

Stay
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
Stay away
God is gay


@SONG: On A Plain


I'll start this off
Without any words
I got so high that
I scratched 'til I bled

Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

The finest day
That I ever had
Was when I learned
To cry on command

Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

My mother died
Every night
It's safe to say
Don't quote me on that

Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

The black sheep got
Blackmailed again
Forgot to put
On the zip code

Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don't make a sense

Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

One more special
Message to go
And then I'm done
And I can go home

Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on aplain
I can't complain


@SONG: Something In The Way


Underneath the bridge
The tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
But it's ok to eat fish
Cause they haven't any feelings

Something in the way
Ummmmm
Something in the way, yea
Ummmmm
Something in the way
Ummmmm
Something in the way, yea
Ummmmm
Something in the way
Ummmmm
Something in the way, yea
Ummmmm

Underneath the bridge
The tarp has sprung a leak

Something in the way
Ummmmm
Something in the way, yea
Ummmmm
Something in the way
Ummmmm
Something in the way, yea
Ummmmm

Something in the way, yea
Ummmmm
