Heep - The Wizard</B> <BR><BR>He was the wizard of a thousand kings <BR>And a 
chance to meet him one night wondering <BR>He told me tales and he drank my wine 
<BR>Me and my magic man kinda feeling fine <BR><BR>He had a cloak of gold and 
eyes of fire <BR>And as he spoke I felt a deep desire <BR>To free the world of 
its fear and pain <BR>And help the people to feel free again <BR><BR>Why don't 
we listen to the voices in our hearts? <BR>Cause then I know we'll find we're 
not so far apart <BR>Everybody's got to be happy, everyone should see <BR>For we 
know the joy of life and peace that love can bring <BR><BR>So spoke the wizard

Guardian - The script for my requiem</B> <BR><BR>Hallowed be the fatherland 
<BR>God he knows <BR>How long I'd been away from here <BR>I did start a search 
so full of desease <BR>I still hear my cryouts <BR>From the old cellar's inside 
<BR><BR>Born in the days of medieval <BR>My inner voice is always asking why 
<BR><BR>I came from nowhere <BR>Without a task, without a name <BR>No fear of 
evil fate <BR>So god please lead me through <BR>Forgotten realms <BR>Mysterious 
dreams <BR>In sunless rooms I'd sworn <BR>I'll finish what I started once 
<BR>I'll find my holy grail <BR>In the holy land <BR><BR>Returning of the 
miracles <BR>It's my own requiem <BR>The jester's tears <BR>They are inside me 
<BR>Agony's the script for my requiem <BR>Returning of the miracles <BR>It's my 
own requiem <BR>Is the script already written <BR>Jester's tears I cry 
<BR><BR>Yes I cry <BR><BR>I went out of my mind <BR>In desert lands 
<BR>Insanity's pawn <BR>Out of control <BR>Much too long I've been isolated 
<BR>From my thoughts <BR>Enclosed by the leader's spell <BR>Bewildered to mare 
<BR>As a glory knight <BR>And I tried <BR><BR>Still I hear the scream of 
thousands: <BR>"Crucify, crucify!!! <BR>Take it all our gold, our home, our life 
<BR>But we didn't kill your Christ <BR>Reach out for your holy grail <BR>Enslave 
us and make us your god's sacrifice!!" <BR><BR>Chorus <BR><BR>SOLO <BR><BR>Still 
I'm confused <BR>If I was dreaming <BR>Too late I realized <BR>I'd been another 
fool <BR>I pay the price <BR><BR>Chorus </DIV></DIV>
