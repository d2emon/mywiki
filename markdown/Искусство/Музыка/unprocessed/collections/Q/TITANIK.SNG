                           A              E
                          Every night in my dreams
                              D          E
                           I see you, I feel you,
                         That is how I know you go on
                           Far across the distance
                            And spaces between us
                        You have come to show you go on

                            A     E       D        E
                           Near, far, wherever you are
                       I believe that the heart does go on
                           Once more you open the door
                           And you're here in my heart
                          And my heart will go on and on

                           Love can touch us one time
                            And last for a lifetime
                         And never let go till we're gone
                            Love was when I loved you
                            One true time I hold to
                          In my life we'll always go on

                           Near, far, wherever you are
                       I believe that the heart does go on
                           Once more you open the door
                           And you're here in my heart
                          And my heart will go on and on

                         H      F#            E         F#
                        You're here, there's nothing I fear,
                        And I know that my heart will go on
                            We'll stay forever this way
                             You are safe in my heart
                          And my heart will go on and on
