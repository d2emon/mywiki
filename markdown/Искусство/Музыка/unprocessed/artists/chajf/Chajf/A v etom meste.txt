The name ChaiF was invented after drinking lots of tea and getting high on it (from the Russian words 'chai' for 'tea' and 'kaif' for 'getting high on smth.') This cannot be proven however to this day the musicians drink a lot of tea. The heart of ChaiF is two guitars - Vladimir Shachrin and Vladimir Begunov who started together by playing Cridens and Rolling Stones songs. 
First career move was made in 1984 and in 1985 the group releases their first album 'Life in a Rose Smoke'. The first ChaiF consisted of also drummer Oleg Reshetnikov and Vadim Kukushkin playing the trumpet. In 1986, a family duet joined ChaiF - a bass player Anton Nifantiev and singer Alina Nifantieva. Strong lyrics and rock'n'roll/blues style is what got the attention of listeners when the group performed at the 1st Festival of Sverdlovsk Rock-Club. It also released the second album called 'Saturday Night in Sverdlovsk' together with almost all rock-musicians from Sverdlovsk. 
By 1987 all other members besides the original duet have left and Vladimir Nazimov joined (drums) the band. That year ChaiF together with Nautilus Pompilius and other groups went to Leningrad where they gave several triumphal performances. Since then the group became phenomenal popular. 
Then Nazimov who left to Nautilus was replaced by Igor Zlobin from Time Out and from the same band, a guitar player Pavel Ustugov joined ChaiF as well. They released another two albums. Their music became heavier. In 1989 both x-Time Out members left the group and were replaced by Valery Severin on drums. The band has also become an organiser of the ecologic movement 'Rock of the Clean Water' which combined rock-musicians from Ural, Povozhie and Leningrad. 
In 1990 two other musicians were invited to play with the band: bass player Vladimir Privalov and a violinist Vladimir Cheltovskich. In autumn 1990 the band released a soundtrack for the movie 'The Fourth Chair'.
