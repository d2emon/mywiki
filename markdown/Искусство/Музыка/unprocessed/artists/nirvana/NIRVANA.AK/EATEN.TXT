SHREDDED HUMANS
Lyrics: Jack & Chris

Early hours, open road, family of five-on their way home
Having enjoyed a day in the sun, their
encounter with gore has just begun
A homicidal fool not knowing left from right,
now has the family in his sight
Trying to perceive if he's blind or insane, he
steers his car into the other lane

Both of them collide, expressions horrified
Head on at full speed, the vultures will soon feed

The father of three was impaled on the wheel,
as his skull became part of the dash
His eyeballs ejected his sight uneffected, he
saw his own organs collapse
His seatbelt was useless for holding him back,
if simply cut him in two
Legs were crushed, out leaked puss as his
spinal cord took off and flew
The mother took flight through the glass, and
ended up impaled on a sign
Her intestines stretched from the car down the
road for a quarter of a mile

Fourth child on the way, won't live another day
Fetus on the road, with mangled little bones
Little children  fly, not a chance to wonder why
Smashed against the ceiling, all their skin
burning and peeling
Schards of glass explode, chest and skull now implode
Corpses they've become, and graves will have to be dug

Underneath the wheels, burning rubber on your face
Bleeding from your eyes, the slaughtered victim lies
Knowing what he's done, he just backs up one more time
Laughing at the mess, a pile of meat on the street

One child left slowly dying now, arteries gushing
blood
Now it's time to feed on flesh, the gore has just begun

Early hours, open road, family of five on their way home
Having enjoyed a day in the sun, their
encounter with gore has just begun
A homicidal fool not knowing left from right,
now has the family in his sight
Trying to perceive if he's blind or insane, he
steers his car into the other lane

The look of death in my eye
Surely no-one will survive
Just a pile of mush
Left to dry in the sun

I see my fresh kill
Left in the road
Remains of your bodies
Mangled and torn

Solo: Bob
Solo: Jack

One child left slowly dying now, arteries gushing blood
Now it's time to feed on flesh, the gore has just begun

     EDIBLE AUTOPSY
     Lyrics: Chris

     Wheeled in on a cart, lying dormant not dead
     Hospital of immortality, butcher  their patients bloody red
     Taken to a dark room, fear of impending doom
     The doctor straps you down, with an evil grin
     Grabs his rusty blade, ripping through flesh and vein
     He tortures his patients through evil means

     You can't try to fight them, first they change your brain
     beyond the realm of evil, their means are insane
     Mutilated beyond belief, but still kept alive
     Pathologist of death gouging out your eyes

     Guts and blood, bones are broken
     As they eat your pancreas
     Human liver, for their dinner
     Or maybe  soup with eyes
     Cause of death, still unknown
     Gnawing meat, from your bones
     Bone saw binding in your skull
     Brains are oozing a human stump
     Needles injected, through your eyes
     Pulling off flesh, skinned alive

     Killing for free in blood they will trust, and they
     must never forsake
     feeding on blood that brought them abound, and
     they must kill tonight
     Genocide, suicide, screaming cries, in hell you will die

     Lying dormant not dead
     Hospital of immortality, butcher their patients bloody red
     Taken to a dark room, fear of impending doom
     The doctor straps you down, with an evil grin
     Grabs his rusty blade, ripping through flesh and vein
     He tortures his patients through evil means

     PUT THEM TO DEATH
     Lyrics: Chris

     Evil people with evil minds
     Slaughter their victims with ripping knives
     They should be caught and put to death
     Strapped to the chair, they should die there

     Blood spewing from their eyes
     As you hear their sinful cries
     Destroy their evil minds
     We should take their fucking lives
     They should be caught and punished
     For what they have done
     Torture them slowly it would be fun
     Kill them all off one by one

     Let them go - no torture them slow
     Fuck you - and your kind
     We don't need you, or your lives
     Execute by injection
     Execution by electricution

     Evil people with evil minds
     Slaughter their victims with ripping knives
     They should be caught and put to death
     Strapped to the chair, they should die there

     MANGLED
     Lyrics: Chris & Paul

     Demolition of bodies, smashed and broken,
     piles of guts, moist and steaming
     Tendons severing, brains are boiling, unburied
     corpses in state of decay
     Rotten limbs start to ferment, torso's torn in two
     Skin ripped off to expose muscle tissue,
     butchered for human stew
     Crawl into the cadaver head first, eat your way
     through the guts
     The pungent smell of decaying innards is
     enough to drive your nuts
     The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your mouth
     As you chew on the piss fill kidneys
     Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving
     nothing but bones
     Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of
     death fill the air
     Bones sticking out, ripped from sockets, blood
     spurting everywhere
     Victim lying dead, neck but no head, smearing
     remains on your own face
     Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of
     death fill the air

     Blistering flesh, another death, stiffened bones,
     morbid groans
     Evil mind, brain oozing slime, feel the pain
     Body weak brain contorting, fluid flowing from
     your organs
     Veins torn out, Mangled
     Festering flesh, quivering cadaver, ligaments
     stretched around your own neck
     Drink the puss, Mangled
     Severed dick, blody bowels, the gutted corpse
     now lies hollow
     Feeding on feces, Mangled
     Amputated arms,  crushing legs, head is ripped
     right off your shoulders
     Thrown in a pile, Mangled
     Limbs rearranged, head on backwards a
     humongous heep of twisted flesh
     Sewn together, Mangled - Mangled

     His knife plunges in, your cold battered body
     Blood seeping through, the jagged  wounds he cuts
     Unbearable pain, give into death
     Your life slips away, perish in blood

     Menacing madman mutilating
     Destroying disfiguring, dead you'll be
     Crushing cracking killing you
     Annihiliation, desecration

     Born through modern day science
     Man has made his last mistake
     A creature so hideously horrible
     Leaving nothing to waste
     Evil has a new face, a mangled horrible face
     His views are those of death, nothing will stop his lust
     Slicing victims left to decay, listening to their
     mortal cries
     Unhuman, immortal, beastial, now he owns
     your soul
     Crawl into the cadaver head first, eat your way
     through the guts
     The pungent smell of decaying innards is
     enough to drive you nuts
     The spleen of the carcass is oozing from your mouth
     As you chew on the piss fill kidneys
     Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving
     nothing but bones

     Human converted to beast, the perfect killing
     machine
     Psychotic structure of brain tissue, murder his
     only memory
     Dependant on death, crushing your head, I'm
     addicted to blood
     Chew the decay

     Solo: Bob

     The weakened man must die, tearing out his
     insides
     Smashing all the bones, hear his tormenting
     groans

     Solo: Jack

     SCATTERED REMAINS, SPLATTERED BRAINS
     Lyrics: Jack & Chris

     Prepare to witness a place of gore
     Of legal disection and blood on the floor
     Carved up corpses, in the corner
     Sliced up by a psychotic coroner
     Slice, dice, chop them up haphazardly
     Like laboratory mice, splatter brain matter
     Pound on the skull until it shatters

     Hack, slice, chop, carve, rip and tear
     Carving out your eyeballs, watch them sit and stare
     Tear, rip, slice, carve, chop, hack
     Toss them into a sack

     Tags on bare feet, means a real treat, to the
     butcher of human meat
     Slice the throat from ear to ear, gallons of blood
     do appear
     Veins exposed, torn from bodies, the most
     interesting of hobbies
     To get paid for such a task is more than any
     man could ask

     Prepare to witness a place of gore
     Of legal disection and blood on the floor
     Carved up corpses, in the corner
     Sliced up by a psychotic coroner
     Slice, dice, chop them up haphazardly
     Like laboratory mice, splatter brain matter
     Pound on the skull until it shatters

     Hack, slice, chop, carve, rip and tear
     Carving out your eyeballs, watch them sit and stare
     Tear, rip, slice, carve, chop, hack
     Toss them into a sack

     Ripping, tearing your skin turning red
     Vile surgeon, knife cutting in
     Skull cracking, to expose your brain
     Evil doctor death drove him insane

     BORN IN A CASKET
     Lyrics: Chris

     Enter the crypts of hell, to impregnate the dead
     Fresh burial sight, my hunger grows tonight
     Undying lust for cadaverous molestation
     Sights of death building my sensations
     Ferocious need for decomposing bodies

     Sex with the dead now I must breed
     Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
     The taste of formaldahyde, smell of the rot
     Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch

     Raging fires of hell, burning through my soul
     My love for a dead fuck, I cannot control
     The child soon will rise, all evil will survive
     Birth through death

     The newborn needs a feast, its mother is the meal
     Chomping on her flesh, his teeth tearing her skin

     I love to fuck the dead, demons in my head
     Tearing at my brain

     Bleeding sores beginning to stench
     While you lick the festering stump
     Green infection discharging puss
     Devour the putrid afterbirth

     Sex with the dead now I must breed
     Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
     The taste of formaldahyde, smell of the rot
     Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch

     ROTTING HEAD
     Lyrics: Jack & Chris

     A quivering pile of useless flesh, locked in a padded cell
     Hidden from the prying eyes of curiousity
     Experimental surgery made him what he is today
     His head is rotting but his body lives on as a
     worthless vegetable
     Unknown to mankind, the incredible power of his mind

     Hideous heredity, genetic imbalance, resorting to cannibalism
     A feast begins as the patients skull is cracked
     open like a walnut
     Brains devoured in a frenzied slaughter, thirst
     for gore nothing more
     Bile is dripping, puss from wounds, as the
     coroner drinks it down

     The sights before your eyes you can't describe
     A trip through this living hell will rot away your skull

     Genital lasceratin, anal asyphyxiation
     Blockage of bowel passage, defication, hemmorage
     Cadaverous mutilation, metamorphial radiation
     Devourance of arteries, decapitated extremeties
     Cranial excavation, cerebreal liquidation
     Brain turned to soup, ears are dripping goop

     Slimy, cozing, dripping puss, torn out
     fingernails starting to fuss
     Shredded cartilage victim lies, eye sockets, but no eyes
     Miles of intestines strewn all about, facial
     features strickened with gout
     Hanging bodies dripping with blood, the
     blackened fluid sinks in the mud

     Solo: Bob
     Solo: Jack

     A quivering pile of useless flesh, locked in a padded cell

     THE UNDEAD WILL FEAST
     Lyrics: Jack, Alex & Chris

     Undead feast, as they tear upon your weak flesh
     Terror builds, at the thought of being dead
     Prophecy of the wisemen of old
     Now comes true, as the corpses break the soil
     Ancient spell breaks the sleep of the dead
     The dead awake, what the populace in fearing
     Panic strikes as the nations run in fear
     Ocean boil with blood of human victims

     Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead
     Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh
     Psychotic, transmutated corpses, upsuring the population
     Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us

     Tables turn as a victim I've become now
     State of death only waiting to return
     Vital signs that show I'm dead
     This can't happen, I'm rising from my own grave
     Hunger grows not nutritional but instinctual
     Flesh becomes my only crave of this live
     Unthinking state, a state of metamorphisis
     Seeking food to keep me dead

     Degenerate, a product of man's frustration for his error
     Insatiable hunger for mankind, building with each kill
     Seeking human victims to meet my fill
     Cannibal I've become, what's happened to my brain

     Feast on the corpse, suck out its brain
     As its fluids drip down the drain
     Chew on the bones, drink from its bladder
     The vile stench only makes me madder

     In through the mouth, out the forehead
     Brains fall out, skin turns red
     Violent surge, a spear through the skull
     Felt the urge, now my heart's full

     I crave gore, I'll eat your guts

     I love gore, blood drives me nuts
     I drink blood, I don't like water
     Intestines my cud, I feast in the slaughter
     Twist its neck, make it crack

     Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead
     Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh
     Psychotic, transmutated corpses, upsuring the population
     Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us
     Blood I want to drink, I want to suck
     Brains I want to eat, the rest I'll chuck
     Bones into a spear, I'll carve and kill
     Hunger for the quest, I'll never fill

     Solo: Bob

     I crave gore, I'll eat your guts

     Solo: Jack

     BLOODY CHUNKS
     Lyrics: Chris

     Walking down the street, the smell of death in the air
     What a rotting stench
     My imagination runs wild at what this could be
     Open up the can to discover a dead body

     Or what was left of one, pieces in a bag
     Blood is everywhere what a retched sight
     Cut up really small by a razor sharp knife
     lying in the garbage no one else knows
     What I have found, what should I do
     Take it to the police or make it into stew
     This was an evil committed by the insane
     Looking down laughing, I am the same

     The sight of death drives me nuts, I must kill,
     to control my brain
     Swept away by my lust to cause pain,
     mutilation is my only want
     The evil inside me gives me the strength to kill at will
     My life is the means to cause death in the most sinister ways

     I see it in your eyes the fear that keeps me alive
     I'll take it away, your life will end today
     I'll leave you to rot, what a sick odor
     Scream all you want, but you can't stop this horror

     Tasting your life as I drink your blood
     Ripping out your insides, chewing on your spleen
     Dead or living flesh is what I crave
     I'll kill someone or eat from a grave

     A SKULL FULL OF MAGGOTS
     Lyrics: Chris

     Lying there cold after a torturous death
     Your life ended fast you took your last breath
     Dead in a grave, your final place
     The maggots infest your disfigured face
     Puss through your veins takes the place of blood
     Decay sets in, bones begin to crack
     Thrown six feet down left to rot
     Brains oozing black down the side of your broken neck

     Skull full of maggots

     They enter your tomb - maggots - beginning to feast - maggost
     Crawling on you - maggots - now they eat you - maggots
     Rotting maggots - maggots  - infesting your corpse - maggots
     Parasites of the dead - maggots - now dwell in your head

     Lying there cold after a torturous death
     Your life ended fast you took your last breath
     Dead in a grave, your final place
     The maggots infest your disfigured face
     Puss through your veins takes the place of blood
     Decay sets in, bones begin to crack
     Thrown six feet down left to rot
     Brains oozing black down the side of your broken neck

     BURIED IN THE BACKYARD
     Lyrics: Chris

     To kill, is why I live
     My God, give eternal life
     Slice you, I watch your blood flow
     Rotten brains, I feed 'till I'm full
     Pressure building, the body starts to swell

     The souls of my victims brings me great power
     Feasting on flesh by the hour
     Lungs explode as I cave in your chest
     Probing through your organs - searching for meat
     Chewing the heart of my kill builds my evil will
     Bodies emptied of blood to fill my sacrificial chalice
     I stalk my prey at night, I need to kill tonight
     To strengthen my evil soul, those that I kill
     worship me below
     I am your worst reality, pain and torture of humanity
     Violent ways of insanity, there is no end to this cruelty

     In my grasp, I'll kill you fast, I'll send your soul to hell
     Butchery of Human beings is the only life I know
     My armies of zombies will inherit the erth, and
     answer to my spells
     Mutilated the human race in search for immortals

     I drag the carcass home, it feels stiff and cold
     Incantation of the devil to rob it of its soul
     Consume the lifeless cadaver, I drink your blackened blood
     Its death flows through my body, indulge in its pain

     Crucifixion in the cemetary, awakes the dead
     from their sleep
     Rising from their graves, to devour the weakened mortals
     Under my control, I own their tortured souls
