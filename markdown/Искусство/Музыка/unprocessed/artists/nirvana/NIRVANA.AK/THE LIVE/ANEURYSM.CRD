	Aneurysm - NIRVANA
-------------------
 
This file contains two TABs for Aneurysm: one from Incesticide, and one 
from the "Smells Like Teen Spirit" maxi CD single.  All tabs were written 
by me, if there are any mistakes, don't hesitate to write to me at:
 
amagnes@eis.calstate.edu
 
I'm also looking for other nirvana fans who are interested in exchanging 
nirvana stuff.

Lyrics to Aneurysm - Incesticide
 
Come on over, Do the twist
Overdo it, Have a fit
Love you so much, Makes me sick
Come on over, Do the twist
 
Beat me out of me (Beat up, Beat up) x4
 
Come on over, Do the twist
Overdo it, Have a fit
Come on over, Shoot the shit
Come on over, Do the twist
 
Beat me out of me (Beat up, Beat up) x4
 
She gave the perfect strain to my heart (xbunch of times)
