@SONG: TURNAROUND


Take a step outside yourself
And turn around
Take a look at who you are
It's pretty scary
So silly
Revolting
You're not much
You can't do anything

Take a step outside the city
And turn around
Take a look at what you are
It is revolting
You're really nowhere
So wasteful
So foolish
Poppycock

Who said don't look back?
Don't believe 'em
Go for that Crazy Sam restaurant (?)
'Cos they're gonna try and get behind you
Don't you let them do it
You know what I'm talking about?
You hear me talking?
You hear me talking?

It's pretty scary it's so revolting

Take a step outside the country
And turn around
Take a look at what you are
It is amazing
Take a good look
You're no big deal
You're so petty
It's lots

Take a step outside the planet
Turn around and around
Take a look at where you are
It's pretty scary


@SONG: ANEURISM


Come on over
Do the twist (aha)
Overdo it
Have a fit (aha)
Come on over
Shoot the shit (aha)
Love you so much
Makes me sick (aha)

Beat me out of me (beat up beat up)

She gives a perfect state of mind


@SONG: D7


Straight as an arrow
Defect defect
Not straight, not so straight
Reject reject
Towards anti-social
Solo solo
Standing on the stairs
Cold, cold morning
Ghostly image of fear
Mayday mayday
Gonna leave this region
They'll take me with them

Demented seven


@SONG: SON OF A GUN


Up up up and down
Turn turn turnaround
Round round roundabout
And over again
Gun gun son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference what I say
The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away


@SONG: EVEN IN HIS YOUTH


Even in his youth
Even in his youth
Even in his youth he was nothing

Kept his body clean
Kept his body clean
Kept his body clean going nowhere

Daddy was ashamed
Daddy was ashamed
Daddy was ashamed he was nothing

Smears the family name
Smears the family name
Smears the family name he was something

He was born for your crew
I've got nothing left to prove
If I die before I wake
Hope I don't come back a slave

Even in his youth, yeah yeah


@SONG: MOLLY'S LIPS


She said
She'd take me anywhere
She'd take me anywhere
As long as she stays with me

She said
She'd take me anywhere
She'd take me anywhere
As long as I stayed clean

Kiss kiss
Molly's lips
Kiss kiss
Molly's lips
Kiss kiss
Molly's lips
Kiss kiss
