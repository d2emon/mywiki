@ALBUM: BLEACH

@SONG: Blew

If you wouldn't mind I would like it blew
If you wouldn't mind I would like it loose
If you wouldn't care I would like to leave
If you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe

Is there another reason for your stay
Could you believe him when you discussed his stain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame

If you wouldn't mind I would like it blew
If you wouldn't mind I would like it loose
If you wouldn't care I would like to bleed
If you wouldn't mind I would like to breathe.

Is there another reason for your stay
Could you believe him when you discussed his stain?
Here is another word that rhymes with shame

You could do anything (x8)


@SONG: Floyd the Barber

Hello Cobain come on in
Floyd now says my hairy chin
Sit down in the chair don't be afraid
Steaming hot towel on my face

I'm ashamed
        (x3)

Barber ties me to the chair
I can't see I'm really scared
Floyd burns alright he'll sell -?
They depress against my nails

I was ashamed
        (x3)

Lies and suffers in the room
Oh reality / Looking at me I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I die smothered and he's not

I was ashamed
        (x3)


@SONG: About a Girl

I need an easy friend
I do whip her into land - ?
I don't think you fit this shoe
I do, won't you have a clue

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free

I'm standing in your line
I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number too
I do keep a date with you

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free

I need an easy friend
I do whip her in to land
I do think you fit this shoe
I do won't you have a clue

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
No I can't see you every night
Free
I do (x4)

@SONG: School

Won't you believe it
It's just my luck
        (x4)

No recess
        (x3)

Won't you believe it
It's just my luck
        (x4)

No recess
        (x3)

You're in high school again
        (x8)

No recess
        (x7)

@SONG: Love Buzz

Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the queen of my heart
Please don't deceive me when I hurt you
Just ain't the way it seems

Can you feel my love buzz (x4)

(repeated)

@SONG: Paper Cuts

When I'm feeling tired
She puts you through the door
I crawl towards the cursed alley
Sometimes I can't find my way
This curtain's (Kurt is?) spellbound (still round)
So get all that you can
A cool man is toughening/too plain
A good hosing down

When the hate in my field (ma)eternal all four
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I asked the years ham radio blew
And the car, twist, mouth, fear!  Yaaah!
I think so
I think so
I think so
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana...

Back when 'twas a party
I scratched with my nails
I see now that she's just like me
Why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the holy ones
They pointed my way
They come with the flashing lights
And take my family away

An-gr-y later I am known to
Slap some friends of ridicule
My whole existence is for your fears
And that is why I'm here with you!
Don't taaaake
Me awaaaaay
You're round
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana
Nirvana...

@SONG: Scoff

In my eyes
I'm not lazy
In my face
It's not over
In your room
I'm not older
In your eyes
I'm not worth it
Gimme back my alcohol (x8)

(First:)
Give me all your... (x 6)

(First and second repetitions:)
Give me all your... (x 5)
Give me your
Love! (?)

Fuck!

@SONG: Swap Meet

They need a lifestyle that is comfortable
They travel far to keep their stomachs full
They make a living off of arts and crafts
The conversations just would (n)ever laugh (?)
They make a deal when they come to town
The Sunday swap meet is a battle ground
She loves it more than he will ever know
He loves it more than he will ever show
 Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart
 Keeps her photographs close to her heart
 Keeps the bus-i-ness close to the heart

        (x3)

@SONG: Mr. Moustache

Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mind and wisdom
Yes I eat cow I am not proud.

Show me how you question, question
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and keep it clean
As I eat cow I am not proud.

Is it an easychair?
Oversized rock
I don't like you anyway
Silver metal box

I'm new
I'm new
(all again, then:)

I'm who?
I'm you--aaaahh!  Aaaah!

@SONG: Sifting

Afraid to grade
Wouldn't it be fun?
Cross, self-loss
Wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed
Wouldn't it be fun?
Some fear none
Wouldn't it be fun?

 Your eyes
 Treat yourself
        (x3)
 Treat yourself

 Don't have nothing for you (x6)
 Don't have nothing but (for?) you

Smell the smell
Wouldn't it be fun?
Search for a church
Wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed
Wouldn't it be fun?
Cold is gold
Wouldn't it be fun?

 Your eyes
 Treat yourself
        (x3)
 Treat yourself (x2)

 Don't have nothing for you(x7)

 Don't have nothing for you (x9)

@SONG: Big Cheese

Big cheese make me
Mine says, "Go to the office"

Big cheese Make me
Mine says, "One that stays"

 Black is black, straight back
 Need more enemies
 Show you all what a man is

Big lies make my
Mine says "Go to the office"

Big cheese Make me
Message?  What is it?

 Black is black straight back
 Need more enemies
 She is glue how are you?

@SONG: Downer

Put your sincerity
I've got a royalty
Defending your country
Wish away

I've had a lobotomy
Save your family
Surrealistic fantasy
Bad boy

Fight!

 All we know is
 Restitution
 Living out your
 Date of future
 There's a hope
 Please show me faster
 Don't forget
 To pass a riot

 Somebody served a dinner
 Much like I am
 I know I can't
 Make enough although
 If you go along
 I sing your song

Sickening pessimists
Picketing masses
Separated communists
Apocalyptic bastards
Rinkydink God
For putting me on this Earth
Being very frivolous
Death in mind

Nurse!

 All we know is
 Restitution
 Living out your
 Date of future
 There's a hope
 Please send it faster
 Don't forget
 To pass a riot

 Somebody served a dinner
 Much like I am
 I know I can't
 Make enough although
 If you go along
 I sing your song.
