Текст песни: You'd better believe me!
Альбом: Штиль

They call me an iron snake 
But in the city house 
All my life in Prison 
Such a fucking feeling - known as well 
But i drooped through the walls 
I ran the wind and won 
All of them are wrong 
I feel so handsome and so proud 


You'd better believe me! 
Then I let them saw the snake 
My death or my control 
All the bikes collating 
I had times to realize that's all 
Dying now i fell so strange 
I never felt astray 
Eyes and wings 
By the body get away 


You'd better believe me! 
I never saw the blinding light 
I will be crusified tonight 
I've got another wind to ride 
Forgive me bless I will be right 
I never saw the blinding light 
I will be crusified tonight 
I've got another wind to ride 

I was calling for my friend 
He didnt hear my voice 
I had got it 
Moving there to dawning day - I had no choice 
Life isnt death and death isnt life 
They are shining only twice 
Dying is nothing Jesus 
I was quite there 
Where sun begins to rise 


You'd better believe me! 
I never saw the blinding light 
I will be crusified tonight 
I've got another wind to ride 
Forgive me bless I will be right 
I never saw the blinding light 
I will be crusified tonight 
I've got another wind to ride
