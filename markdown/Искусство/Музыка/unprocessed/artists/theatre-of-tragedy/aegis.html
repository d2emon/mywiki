<br><i>[Words by Raymond, Music by Theatre of Tragedy]</i><br>
<br>
He gave to her, yet tenfold claim'd in return -<br>
She hath no life but the one he for her wrought;<br>
Proffer'd to her his wauking heart - she turn'd it down,<br>
Riposted with a tell-tale lore of lies and scorn.<br>
<br>
Prophetess or fond?,<br>
Tho' her parle of truth:<br>
"I ken to-morrow - refell me if ye can!",<br>
Yet the kiss and breath - Apollo's bane -<br>
Sëer of the future, not of twain,<br>
"Sicker!", quoth Cassandra.<br>
<br>
Still, is she lief and quaint in his eyne, a sight divine? -<br>
A mistress fuell'd by his prest haughtiness -<br>
If he did grant, wherefore then did he not foresee,<br>
Belike egal as it to him might be?!<br>
<br>
Prophetess or fond?,<br>
Tho' her parle of truth:<br>
"I ken to-morrow - refell me if ye can!",<br>
Yet the kiss and breath - Apollo's bane -<br>
Sëer of the future, not of twain,<br>
"Sicker!", quoth Cassandra.<br>
<br>
'Or was he an eried being,<br>
'Or was he weening - alack nay mo;<br>
Her naysay' raught his heart,<br>
Her daffing was the grave of all hope -<br>
She belied her own words,<br>
He thought her life, save moreo'er scourge,<br>
She held him august, yet wee;<br>
He left her ne'er without his heart.<br>

<br><i>[Words by Raymond, Music by Theatre of Tragedy]</i><br>
<br>
Ferie dearest, was it loe soothfast or a façade;<br>
A serenade siren'd to lure - Zounds! not to court me?<br>
A menad, yet the sweetest colleen -<br>
Certes didst thou me unveil meekly life pristine.<br>
<br>
Lorelei,<br>
A poet of tragedies, scribe I lauds to Death,<br>
Yet who the hell was I to dare?<br>
Lorelei,<br>
Canst thou not see thou to me needful art?<br>
Canst thou not see the loss of loe painful is?<br>
<br>
Dedally didst thou perform the tragic pasquinade,<br>
For all years a damndest and driegh'd accolade -<br>
Caus'd for all eyes mazed to behold a mêlee;<br>
In the midst did I swainly cast thee my bouquet:<br>
The one and sole faggot that feedeth the fire,<br>
Bellow'd bidingly by my heart's quailing quire.<br>

Lorelei,<br>

Yet who the hell was I to dare?<br>
Lorelei,<br>
Canst thou not see thou to me needful art?<br>
Canst thou not see the loss of loe painful is?<br>
<br>
Perchance author I thee this ikon'd apologue for aught,<br>
Doth the wecht burthen thee?, then bethink thine afterthought:<br>
'Tween Aether and 'Nether art thou the peerless phoenix -<br>
Prithee, darlingmost! - court me rather than the peevish prolix.<br>

<br><i>[Words by Raymond, Music by Theatre of Tragedy]</i><br>
<br>
Thou dawdl'd not bringing me fro Aether to Nether,<br>
Still, duringly cling I on to this heather -<br>
Dew-scented blossom; thou wast pristine,<br>
The sweven of thee ne'er will I cede, my colleen.<br>
Drat this creature of memories ill,<br>
Foolhardy and fey I may be, yet him I shall quell.<br>
<br>
'Vaunt! - Devil tyne -<br>
Wadst thou wane fore'ermae;<br>
Daunt - sinsyne thence,<br>
Ta'en as a dint, Angelique?<br>
<br>
Perforce and grinningly shall I maim in the vie -<br>
Alas dastard! - hanging by the noose die.<br>
<br>
'Vaunt! - Devil tyne -<br>
Wadst thou wane fore'ermae;<br>
Daunt - sinsyne thence,<br>
Ta'en as a dint, Angelique?<br>

'Come not wont to this uncouth Devil!,<br>
Lest to a Devil thou wilt translate...my Angel.<br>
