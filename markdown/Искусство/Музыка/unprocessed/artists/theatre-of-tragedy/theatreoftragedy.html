<a name=1><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>1. A Hamlet For A Slothful Vassal</b></font><br>
<br>Behold a jocund morn indeed! -<br>
Sun on high - birds in sky.<br>
Yonder the whist firth eathing,<br>
Fro where a gale erranteth.<br>
<br>
Ye beholdest but the shadow.<br>
That is a lie!<br>
Mayhap a tithe of trothplight -<br>
Lief I am not!<br>
I deem - e'er and anon!<br>
My words are but a twist.<br>
Tis a feigned lie through loathing,<br>
I say!<br>
To and fro, save hither,<br>
Is thy love.<br>
A dotard gaffer, I daresay...<br>
Not a loth! -<br>
But vying for my kinsmen!<br>
...a sapling not!<br>
Beautiful tyrant!<br>
Fiend angelical!<br>
Dove-feathered raven!<br>
Wolvish-ravening lamb!<br>
A hamlet for a slothful vassal -<br>
Soothing ale for a parched sot.<br>
Hie to tell me<br>
What ye judgest as naught;<br>
I behold the shadow!<br>
Wherefore call me such names;<br>
Nay imp am I!<br>
Thou art my aghast hart -<br>
Grazing in the glade.<br>
<br>
E'er thou sayest aye!<br>
That is a lie!<br>
Thief of a plot!<br>
Lief I am not!<br>
Now go to thy tryst!<br>
My words are but a twist!<br>
Go, leave, totter!<br>
Fare well! - with joy I came,<br>
Until ye dwindlest.<br>
With rue I leave<br>
A morsel, nay more,<br>
Even the orb cannot<br>
For thy journey<br>
Help me melt the ice?!<br>
Hither and thither!<br>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name=2><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>2. Cheerful Dirge</b></font><br>
<br>Hap mirthfulness! - Oh! joy of grand riddance;<br>
Undress me my hauberk! - the wyern hath errant'd.<br>
<br>
Ire of yore - bard of e'eryears -<br>
I deem the brood hath wan'd -<br>
fore'ermore?!<br>
<br>
Fro the chasm of the bosom, bale a hand back.<br>
Hark! my dove - henceforth I bulwark thee! -<br>
Teathers of swans in my pillow - I cede my heart.<br>
Make haste! - I pray - respond my plea!<br>
<br>
Lo! - a sire of great awe - a knight of many battles!<br>
<br>
...And of kinsmen weeping for the slain!<br>
Please! - heed my words;<br>
In thy sorrow I will kiss thy tears -<br>
In thy bliss I will take thee by thy hand -<br>
The sapor of grapes thou shalt savor -<br>
And harken the nighttingale sing oh so blithely!<br>
<br>
On his knees... A plea to harvest<br>
roses;<br>
No heed for the thorns you count!<br>
Wherefore vow me?<br>
Wherefor this gilded proffer?<br>
Wherefore not pay court to a maid more<br>
fair? -<br>
Morn of a joyous day! Hower 'twixt<br>
weed!<br>
Fertile desert! Cheerful dirge!<br>
Misery me not! - man nor beast; envy<br>
me;<br>
Lest'tis an act of wont!<br>
Many are the drapes that my past bury -<br>
Ineffable feeling indulgeth in battles!<br>
<br>
Tisn't what thou vambrace'st thy words with!!;<br>
I bethink dotingly only thy weal -<br>
Forgive me for deeming thee direfully -<br>
Therein abdiding with thee<br>
Yet I was a trifle daunt'd.<br>
Is for me the grandest boon!<br>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name=3><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>3. To These Words I Beheld No Tongue</b></font><br>
<br>Whether the throned Monarch weareth the crown,<br>
Which I know not whether to his belongeth;<br>
Doth he hence the sceptre sway?<br>
Seasoneth he justice? -<br>
Daresay I he doth not,<br>
Will he then use his sceptre as a wand? -<br>
Where doth sit my awe? - Trieth me conjure;<br>
Perchance a spell?; a reptile, a sullied hound? -<br>
Is the gentle rain a quality of his? -<br>
I bethink this fro my thoughts; hitherto, about this,<br>
I beheld to these words no tongue; are the<br>
Monarch's men his thralls or his servants? -<br>
Oft I waylay my tongue -<br>
Those of which are withal by my gnarled heart not heed'd;<br>
Or doth the throstle sing with more glee<br>
At daybreak than than a twilight? -<br>
Brawl not my imp, nor my cherub; reserve my judgement -<br>
Crave not the sword when the bodkin fro ere thine is;<br>
That undiscover'd country; be that<br>
Of calamity, be that of joy, be that of apathy;<br>
Tread not paths of new when those of old are<br>
Far by an only single footstep; walk, be it<br>
On the left, on the right - be it the one which<br>
Straight forward leadeth; the one of correct<br>
I have as until now not heed'd any signs of!<br>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name=4><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>4. Hollow-Hearted, Heart-Departed</b></font><br>
<br>Filthy harlots - the Lord's grape!<br>
With lore ornamented entreating;<br>
Hollow hearted, heart-departed -<br>
Yet thou reapest the blooming rose -<br>
When 'tis the weed which is to be swath'd<br>
<br>
I do, in the blooming flower, pleasure<br>
find!<br>
And me in the yesterday's bind?!<br>
Innocence is reserved for the meek:<br>
Of naught is my grasp ne'er to be!<br>
<br>
Hah! - for thee even a hound holdeth the throne.<br>
Unwanted child of mother! - Plague of plagues!<br>
Father of leprous children.<br>
I wield ye to stint this brawl!<br>
Nigh is the ford - yet harken! - do not thwart!<br>
Desirest thou to do it withal,<br>
I shall cause thy body by one head too short!<br>
Sayest ye nay to my boon;<br>
Then wilt thou from bloodshed swoon!<br>
<br>
Err me not! - Must ye bethink my foolhardiness!<br>
Be vanished! - Be banished! -<br>
If ye deemest me not wroth.<br>
My hand hieth to unsheathe the sword<br>
Lest thou dost totter -<br>
Whid along! - Wherefore irk my haughtiness?<br>
<br>
No man... No man at all!,<br>
Wherefore bereave<br>
Be it lord or beggar<br>
The kine of the sward?<br>
Bereaveth my dignity!<br>
Wherefore holdest thou for<br>
Me such a quality scowl?<br>
Loom my darling sun -<br>
Bear the scarlet colour!<br>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name=5><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>5. ...A Distance There Is...</b></font><br>
<br>Come in out of the rain thou sayest - but thou ne'er step'st aside;<br>
And I am trapp'd -<br>
A distance there is...<br>
None, save me and the bodkin - pitter-patter on the roof:<br>
Behold! - 'tis not the rain; thence me it has to be -<br>
I will not drink thy vintage wine, my dear;<br>
Thou hast heed'd that I am of innocence, yet thou let'st thy lass into peril<br>
-<br>
Thou let'st me be parched;<br>
My heart is of frailty, my pale skin is hued damask.<br>
When thou thy tears hast hidden, "Come back!", thou sayest -<br>
There I soon am to be - but how am I to run when my bones, my heart!<br>
Thou hast me bereaft! -<br>
But run thou sayest; I run -<br>
And there and then I behold that a time will come when I again dead will be.<br>
Thou tell'st me to leave without delay -<br>
I leave with my bodkin and my tears in my hands;<br>
Lo! - the shadows, the sky - descending;<br>
So by a dint of smite I gait ere I run and melt together with dusk.<br>
In my mind in which is this event,<br>
But it seems as if naught is to change anyway?!<br>
After all these years thou left'st me down in the emotional depths -<br>
The sombre soaked velvet-drape is hung upon me,<br>
Turning my feelings away from our so ignorant world:<br>
All the beatiful moments shared, deliberatlely push'd aside -<br>
...a distance there is...<br>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name=6><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>6. Sweet Art Thou</b></font><br>
<br>Stay still patient; wilt thou my sister of merciful troth be?<br>
I shall attempt the halter of thy life make less lighten'd!<br>
<br>
I shall climb the yew,<br>
Will it subdue me or not!<br>
<br>
Swooning emotions smite my bosom -<br>
I have in aptness depriev'd thy eyrie<br>
Oh! - but ne'er alas;<br>
Fro many another a lass -<br>
Lodge here fore'ermore.<br>
Dodge thither sable of yore!<br>
<br>
A narrow dell hath now for me turn'd into a broad land;<br>
A land rich with fields of the Simbelmyne.<br>
<br>
Sonorous to my ears are the words form'd by thy tongue;<br>
Conquer me! - Waylay me! - Swathe me 'twixt thy arms!<br>
Make me sense the wine which is drunk by queens,<br>
And let it flow white and full in tast o'er my lips.<br>
<br>
Make me sense the wine which is drunk by kings,<br>
And let it flow red and full in taste o'er my lips.<br>
<br>
A dais'd bridge o'er the ghyll,<br>
In which a river bottomless -<br>
I would have drowned,<br>
Yet thou drewest me out soaking!<br>
<br>
Save thou art not yet all parched -<br>
Eavesdroppest ye: A wee drop,<br>
I can hear it! - I can feel it!<br>
Whence it comes I can only deem,<br>
Yet I will not tarry idly!<br>
Lest this for me is a gay dream:<br>
Let it adamant be -<br>
A dream that will sojourn eternally -<br>
Empty the flagon in me!<br>
In which theatre I will act!<br>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name=7><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>7. Mire</b></font><br>
<br>Harken! - the clouds mustered in dark -<br>
So painfully easing.<br>
Hush! - hearest ye the yew doting;<br>
Its years of yore in a mire,<br>
Each like a corpse within its grave;<br>
Wrought for us a yearn of lief;<br>
Tis not a lore of bale nor loathe;<br>
Harmony and aesthesia are its blisses;<br>
Ne'er ere hath it exist'd so sonorously -<br>
Jostl'd away the pale drape<br>
That us had been o'erhung -<br>
Tempt'd thy shutters to open<br>
And thus quench'd the hearth;<br>
Thou giv'st to misery all thou hast: the cold -<br>
With weal embrac'd the sprounting landscape<br>
Like a star of heaven in the broad daylight -<br>
This joy subdueth until it again waneth,<br>
Save the drooping winter of stalwart.<br>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name=8><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>8. Dying - I Only Feel Apathy</b></font><br>
<br>Now as I am to be bereaft of my troth<br>
I cry aloud my last words of lost hope.<br>
A violent gust of wind is my frame of mind;<br>
Huxes like moisture through pores.<br>
<br>
I am unwilling to forgive<br>
Him who depriev'd me of my life -<br>
Gloaming the sequence -<br>
A momentary view.<br>
Perishing intervals of rejoice -<br>
My supreme happiness is lost!<br>
<br>
Baleful emotions of fear - my body is the earth -<br>
The earth is now destined to be made forlorn -<br>
Forlorn from the enlivening energies.<br>
Am I not anylonger living?<br>
<br>
In mournful silence I suffer -<br>
In peace I now will rest.<br>
My hard-working hands<br>
Are now reposed.<br>
<br>
I close thee my beloved into my heart -<br>
Conceal thy memory in my inner sanctum.<br>
In my thoughts thou shalt forever be -<br>
As a dear and precious remembrance.<br>
<br>
I'm dethroned in the reign of entity -<br>
My tears descend like of abony -<br>
Life is the theatre of tragedy -<br>
Dying - I only feel apathy!<br>
<BR>
