<br>Look up here<br>
Look down there<br>
I am the new man<br>
I'm tangled in wires<br>
Chipset adept<br>
Memory load<br>
Keep your vogue code that all have<br>
Tomorrow's world we've all seen<br>
Keep your modern ways<br>
And keep your bugs<br>
The Metal Man is here to stay<br>
<br>
Talk talk<br>
You say I only work, all night and day<br>
Talk talk<br>
Do say 'Use me, I'm cheap to rent'<br>
<br>
Computerised<br>
Voice synthesised<br>
Call me the mech man<br>
In a world of machines<br>
What can I do but to serve<br>
Store the data and calculate<br>
Speak and spell and operate<br>
Engineer the rail and motorway<br>
Automaton of yesterday<br>
<br>
Talk talk<br>
You say I only work, all night and day<br>
Talk talk<br>
Do say 'Use me, I'm cheap to rent'<br>

<a name=2><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>2. City Of Light</b></font><br>
<br>High-rise buildings<br>
Low cost apartments<br>
Financial district<br>
Industrial area<br>
Rows of blue collars<br>
Steelworkers' clink-clang<br>
Metal rhythm left and right<br>
This is the city, city of light<br>
<br>
Flicker<br>
Click on<br>
Click off<br>
Click on<br>
The faceless men<br>
The machines of the city<br>
<br>
6 p.m. whistle<br>
Next the inner city<br>
Smiling grimey faces<br>
Tea at the local pub<br>
Low-cut dresses<br>
High-spirited workers<br>
Sizzling neon-lights, click on<br>
This is the city, city of light<br>
<br>
Flicker<br>
Click on<br>
Click off<br>
Click on<br>
The faceless men<br>
The machines of the city<br>
<br>
2 a.m. binge<br>
Low-life slagheap<br>
Used up and burnt out<br>
Like a kick in the teeth<br>
Ramble, shamble on home<br>
Grime back in harness<br>
Metal rhythm left and right<br>
This is the city, city of light<br>

<a name=3><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>3. Fragment</b></font><br>
<br>Broken frames<br>
Shattered glass<br>
Like a monochrome film<br>
The replaceable background<br>
Flickers and dissolves<br>
Out of control<br>
<br>
There's no sense, it's all Volta, Amp?re and Ohm<br>
Earth to Moon, it's the same as London-Rome<br>
<br>
Out of focus, blurred image<br>
As solid as a liquid monument<br>
A second of life<br>
The time-frame of '69<br>
Technology, machinery, humanity<br>
It's all the same<br>
<br>
There's no sense, it's all Volta, Amp?re and Ohm<br>
Earth to Moon, it's the same as London-Rome<br>
<br>
Time and age, what's the difference<br>
Based upon the same reference<br>
Touch-and-go, who's to know the random order<br>
Contorted, distorted it doesn't make any sense at all<br>
A fragment, a segment - bits and pieces, bits and Hz<br>
Angular, circular<br>
It's all the same<br>
<br>
There's no sense, it's all Volta, Amp?re and Ohm<br>
Earth to Moon, it's the same as London-Rome<br>
<BR>

<a name=4><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>4. Musique</b></font><br>
<br>I synthesise and press a lighted key<br>
Turn it on, compose a melody<br>
Redo from start, I need more rhythm<br>
1 and 4 was for the Commodore<br>
A catchy beat, I put it on repeat<br>
I program more, but still it's incomplete<br>
Start and stop, where's the perfect pitch?<br>
I won't give up until I tap my feet.<br>
<br>
I'm gonna make a perfect line<br>
Gonna make it stick to your mind<br>
I won't give up that magic rhyme<br>
Got to hear it just one more time<br>
<br>
Computer music is just like oxygen<br>
Try and fail, again, again, again<br>
I need the recipe for the perfect melody<br>
I add more tracks, run out of DSP<br>
Timbre and tone, I want it synthetic<br>
Knobs and sliders, no button pushing matrix<br>
Dadaistic, nothing too profound<br>
Electric music resounding all around<br>
<br>
I'm gonna make a perfect line<br>
Gonna make it stick to your mind<br>
I won't give up that magic rhyme<br>
Got to hear it just one more time<br>
<BR>

<a name=5><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>5. Commute</b></font><br>
<br>Mobile phones<br>
Commuter trains<br>
The Terminus is full of men<br>
Crisscross network<br>
Zigzag railway<br>
The next stop is Waterloo<br>
<br>
White-collar timetable<br>
9 to 5 urban robot<br>
<br>
Standby, I'm on a trip with you<br>
Standby, I thought it lasted through<br>
Standby, I'm on a trip with you<br>
It's more fun to commute<br>
<br>
Take the Tube<br>
Take the M25<br>
There's traffic jam all around<br>
Double-decker<br>
A fare to Chequers<br>
To tell about my points of view<br>
<br>
Standby, I'm on a trip with you<br>
Standby, I thought it lasted through<br>
Standby, I'm on a trip with you<br>
It's more fun to commute<br>
<br>
Public transport<br>
No need for comfort<br>
It's all so and so, touch-and-go<br>
Pass a train wreck<br>
Call the tube-tech<br>
I'll make it to work some other day<br>

He pulls<br>
She pushed<br>
I read the papers in the transit lounge<br>
I dial the number<br>
Now I'm certain<br>
I'll make it home some other day<br>

<a name=6><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>6. Radio</b></font><br>
<br>Electric broadcast<br>
The new transmission waves<br>
Turn the dial<br>
Transistor radio<br>
The deadpan voice I want to hear<br>
Recieve the news<br>
Recieve the tunes<br>
We've tuned in to the ether melody<br>
It's bright and clear and full of energy<br>
Music won't stop<br>
Electro pop<br>
Commercial workshop<br>
I want your time, I need your time to make a rhyme<br>
<br>
On the radio now<br>
Ether melody news<br>
For you and me<br>
<br>
Antennae beaming sound, news and speech<br>
Marconi's words<br>
'Let it be so'<br>
Apparatus signal it out<br>
Information<br>
Communication<br>
We're in the building of the wireless voice<br>
Static morse<br>
Radar, television<br>
The interference<br>
Incoherence<br>
Scrambled signals<br>
I want your waves<br>
Spectral sound<br>
Tune in, tune out<br>
<br>
On the radio now<br>
Ether melody news<br>
For you and me<br>
<br>
Radio for you and me<br>
The airwaves are fully free<br>
Radio for you and me<br>
Oscillating energy<br>
<br>
On the radio now<br>
Ether melody news<br>
For you and me<br>

<a name=7><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>7. Image</b></font><br>
<br>You act a pansy, pushover<br>
Do live your fancy, go lower<br>
Who is that, something says your name<br>
You seem chancy, moreover<br>
The call is mine<br>
<br>
I'm gonna get you up<br>
I'm gonna get on top<br>
The call is mine<br>
<br>
On the skew, you're dancing all over<br>
You are the anti-fashion statement<br>
In a blue suit, orange pullover<br>
You look like my old dog Rover<br>
<br>
I'm gonna get you up<br>
I'm gonna get on top<br>
The call is mine<br>
<BR>

<a name=8><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>8. Crash / Concrete</b></font><br>
<br><i>[lyrics by Raymond I. Rohonyi]</i><br>
<i>[music by Theatre of Tragedy]</i><br>
<br>
Head crash - I can't see you<br>
Spit teeth - I can hear you<br>
I feel your pounding me onto the street<br>
I've learned to know the taste of concrete<br>
<br>
Why don't you follow me?<br>
<br>
Street brash - time flies, tick-tock<br>
Eyes flash - feels like electroshock<br>
I feel the blood gushing, crumbling away<br>
I know this marks the end of my hey-day<br>
<br>
Why don't you follow me?<br>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name=9><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>9. Retrospect</b></font><br>
<br>Here we are<br>
We stand in line<br>
One more time today<br>
There is no sense<br>
The cigarette in hand<br>
It's all gone bad<br>
No name, privilege, no hope and fame<br>
<br>
We've seen it all before<br>
And it seems like a mirror of our future<br>
<br>
We were waiting for something<br>
We were listening to the heartbeats<br>
It could take us<br>
It could take our names; it's the same as no hope and fame<br>
<br>
We've seen it all before<br>
And it seems like a mirror of our future<br>
<br>
This is no age for us<br>
It seems we're out of class<br>
We are fragile<br>
Like statues made of sand<br>
<br>
We've seen it all before<br>
And it seems like a mirror of our future<br>
<BR>

<a name=10><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>10. Reverie</b></font><br>
<br>Car-crash and an elevator<br>
Make you someone else<br>
Never try yourself<br>
Restore you<br>
Tick-tock clock and teddy boys<br>
Bop 'till you're fagged out<br>
Open windows shout<br>
She wore me, she wore you<br>
<br>
Walk these streets<br>
She's concrete<br>
Reverie<br>
All is free<br>
<br>
Knick-knack, flashy bric-a-brac<br>
Seesaw heartbeat, she is back<br>
Windscreen eyes are black and blue<br>
She saw you<br>
The Fleet Street scooter-boys are due<br>
They want to see you<br>
You're vogue and hip and on a rendezvous<br>
Adore you<br>
<br>
Walk these streets<br>
She's concrete<br>
Reverie<br>
All is free<br>
<BR>

<a name=12><FONT color=#DDDDDD><b>12. The New Man</b></font><br>
<br>Broken bottles, and a broken nose<br>
No reason not to lounge in a pose<br>
I could stand in shade light and laugh at you<br>
You were wrong - it's happened to you too<br>
<br>
This is the new circuit<br>
Tell me of your pain<br>
'Shove you around?', now close the door<br>
This is not love<br>
This is my sort of softly touching you<br>
A Brownian motion of whacks on your face<br>
'Who are you?'<br>
<br>
Hat-stand man-man in a fancy suit<br>
He's a laugh, it's him and Jim and his prostitute<br>
Gold teeth spat out onto the concrete street<br>
Get into the car with its vinyl seats<br>
<br>
This is the new circuit<br>
Tell me of your pain<br>
'Shove you around?', now close the door<br>
This is not love<br>
This is my sort of softly touching you<br>
A Brownian motion of whacks on your face<br>
'who are you?'<br>
This is not the new man<br>
'who are you?'<br>
This is not the new man<br>
This is not love<br>
