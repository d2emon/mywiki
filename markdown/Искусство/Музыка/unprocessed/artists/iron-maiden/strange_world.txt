IRON MAIDEN   Strange World
from the album Iron Maiden (1980)

Em                   G
The only place where you can dream,
D             C
Liven here is not what it seems.
Em             G
Ship of white, light in the sky,
D               C
Nobody there to reason why.
Em             G
Here I am, I'm not really there,
D             C
Smiling faces ever so rare.
Em              G
A let's walk in deepest space,
D                 C
Living here, just isn't the place.


Em             G
Stalk of light come from the ground,
D                C
When I cry there isn't a sound.
Em              G
All my feelings cannot be held,
D               C
I'm happy in my new strange world.
Em               G
Shades of green, grasses twine,
D              C
Girls drinking plasma wine.
Em                G
A look at love, a dream enfolds,
D                 C                 Em
Liven here you'll never grow old.


Don't you hear me call?
