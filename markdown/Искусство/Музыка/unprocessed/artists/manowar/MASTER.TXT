                             Master of the Wind
                                by Manowar
                 Taken from the album The Triumph of Steel

Modified 23.2.1995

Transcribed by Mikko Issakainen (miissaka@jyu.fi) and
               Saku Kaariainen (sakaaria@jyu.fi).
               
I got some corrections from Nick Gails (el94009@central.ntua.gr) and Jiri 
Kala (kala@econ.muni.cz). Three chords were wrong in the chorus 
and those '7-chords' were changed to normal chords.

I added the bass, which plays only open E and D strings. It is marked 
like this: (E) or (D).

In verses you must pick the chords only once (check the style from the
record) but in chorus part the strumming goes like this:
                  1   2   3   4    (4/4 beats)
                 Em
                |-0---0-0-0---0-0-|     Each chord lasts only one bar
                |-0---0-0-0---0-0-|
                |-0---0-0-0---0-0-|
                |-2---2-2-2---2-2-|
                |-2---2-2-2---2-2-|
                |-0---0-0-0---0-0-|

The piano in the bridge part goes like chords...
All kinds of comments are welcome! I hope you enjoy this great song.

(E)           Em             (D)
In the silence of the darkness when all are fast
Em    (E)                   Em
Asleep I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
(D)                     Em
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing
(E)               Em
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
D (Both)                Em
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
                    Em
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
     (D)                          Em
We'll carry all our dreams in a single dream of light


C          B     C             B 
Close your eyes, look into the dream
C        B           C                B     
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring


CHORUS:

Em   C       G               D   Em             C
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end
    G            B     Em               C   
For each of us to find there the road begins
G                  D       Em     
where another one will end here the four winds
C             B                  B
Know who will break and who will bend
C             D             Em
All to be the master of the wind



             Em              (D)
Falling stars now light my way my life was
       Em         (E)           Em
Written on the wind clouds above, clouds
    (D)                    Em
Below high ascend the dream within
                           Em
When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move
    (D)                                Em
Aside there will be the road to all our dreams
                       Em
For any day that stings two better days it brings
D 
Nothing is as bad as it seems


C          B     C             B 
Close your eyes, look into the dream
C        B           C                B
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring


Repeat chorus a couple of times and fade.
