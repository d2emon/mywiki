					HELLO GOODBYE
				John Lennon, Paul McCartney
			    From the album "Magical Mystery Tour"

You say yes
I say no
You say stop
And I say go, go, go!
Oh, no

You say goodbye, and I say hello

Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

I say high
You say low
You say why
And I say I don't know
Oh, no

You say goodbye, and I say hello

Hello, hello
(Hello, goodbye, hello, goodbye)
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
(Hello, goodbye			hello, goodbye)
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

(Middle-eight of song precedes verse but contains distant McCartney vocal)

La-la-la-la-la-la, do you say
Goodbye?
Oh, no

You say goodbye, and I say hello

Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

You say yes
(I say yes)
I say no
(Do-re-mi-no)
You say stop
(I can stay)
And I say go, go, go
(Till it's time to go)
Oh, no

You say goodbye, and I say hello

Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello-o-o-o-o-o
Hello-o-o

(Outro)

Hey-la!
Hey-hey-lo-la!
Hey-la!
Hey-hey-lo-la!
(repeat and fade)
