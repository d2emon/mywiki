All the children sing ...CHORUS

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephant were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing ...CHORUS

The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce" his mommy butted in
"If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing ...CHORUS
