<pre><font size="3"><strong>Some Say The Devil Is Dead
</strong></font>(Derek Warfield)

Chorus:
C	    F              
Some say the Devil is dead, Devil is dead, the Devil is dead
C	     G  C
Some say the Devil is dead and buried in Killarney
        F
More say he rose again, more say he rose again
C   	      G C
More say he rose again and joined the British Army 



Feed the pigs and milk the cow, milk the cow, milk the cow
Feed the pigs and milk the cow and early in the morning
Cock your leg up Paddy dear, Paddy dear I'm over here
Cock your leg up Paddy dear it's time to stop your yawnin' 

Chorus:

Katie she is tall and thin, tall 'n thin, tall 'n thin
Katie she is tall and thin and likes her drops of Brandy
Drinks it in the bed each night, drinks it in the bed each night
Drinks it in the bed each night, it makes her nice and randy 

Chorus:

My man is six foot tall, six foot tall, he's six foot tall
My man is six foot tall and likes his sugar candy
Goes to bed at 6 o'clock, goes to bed at 6 o'clock
Goes to bed at 6 o'clock he's lazy fat and bandy 

Chorus:

My wife she has the hairy thing, hairy thing, a hairy thing
The wife she has a hairy thing she showed to me on Sunday
She bought it in a furrier shop, a furrier shop, a furrier shop
She bought it in a furrier shop, it's going back on Monday</pre>
