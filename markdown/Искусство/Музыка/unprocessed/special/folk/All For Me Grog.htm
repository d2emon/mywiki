CH
G                            C           G
And it's all for me grog, me jolly jolly grog
                                      D
All for me beer and tobacco
          G                         C               G
Well I've spent all me tin with the ladies drinking gin
                       D            D7 G
Far across the western ocean I must wander

Verse
I'm sick in the head and I haven't been to bed
Since first I came ashore with me plunder
I've seen centipedes and snakes
And my head is full off aches
And I'll have to make a path for way out yonder

Chorus:

Where are me boots, me noggin' noggin' boots
They're all gone for beer and tobacco
You see the sole's were gettin' thin 
And the uppers were letting in
And the heels are looking out for better weather

Chorus:

Where is me shirt me noggin' noggin' shirt
It's all gone for beer and tobacco
You see the sleeves they got worn out
And the collar was turned about
And the tail is looking out for better weather

Chorus:

Where is me wife me noggin' noggin' wife
She's all gone for beer and tobacco
You see her front it got worn out
And her tail been kicked about
And I'm sure she's looking out for better weather

Chorus:

Oh, where is me bed me noggin' noggin' bed 
It's all gone for beer and tobacco
You see I sold it to the girls 
And the springs they got all twirls
And the sheets they're looking out for better weather

Chorus:</pre>
