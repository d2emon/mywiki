<h1>До XX века</h1>
<h2>Creation of Earth — 1899 A.D.</h2>
<ul>
<li>ca. 4.5 billion years ago – The Sun, Earth and the Moon are created (in one reality, the previous versions of Fry, Bender and Professor Farnsworth watch).</li>
<li>ca. 500 million years ago – An Earth fish crawls onto land (in one reality it is immediately killed by a previous universe's version of Bender).</li>
<li>65.5 million years ago – The Brain Spawn cause the extinction of Earth's dinosaurs while (in one reality, the previous versions of Fry, Bender and Professor Farnsworth watch).</li>
<li>29,000,000 years ago – Nimbala is emperor of Zuban 5.</li>
<li>ca. 40,000 years ago to 1783 A.D. – The previous versions of Fry, Bender and Professor Farnsworth watch the Neanderthals in North America killed by Paleo-Indians (in one reality, they do not watch this).</li>
<li>30,000 years ago Homo sapiens drive the Neanderthals from the Neander Valley. Neanderthals settle in a nearby glacier along with several prehistoric creatures.</li>
<li>3500 B.C. – Cats from Thuban 9 arrive in Egypt where they are worshipped like gods. They make the Egyptians build the Great Pyramid of Giza as a giant energy transfer device.</li>
<li>1351 B.C. – Bender steals a sarcophagus from Egyptians.</li>
<li>ca. 1000 B.C. – The people of Osiris 4 visit Ancient Egypt and learn how to build pyramids, travel through space, and how to prepare their dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.</li>
<li>274 B.C. – Nibbler is born.</li>
<li>1500s – Leonardo from Planet Vinci visits Earth and though considered stupid in his home world, he becomes a genius on Earth. Before he finishes painting the Mona Lisa, it is stolen by a time travelling Bender. Eventually leaves Earth again for his home planet.</li>
<li>1600s – The previous versions of Fry, Bender and the Professor watch (in one reality) the pilgrims arrive in America, and get taken over by the British.</li>
<li>1770s – "Minuteman" Yancy Fry fights "Commies" (according to Fry's father) in the American Revolution (this was viewed by previous versions of Fry, Bender and the Professor).</li>
<ul>
<li>1775 A.D.</li>
<ul>
<li>17 April Fry, Leela, Bender and the Professor appear here after licking George Washington's head.</li>
<ul>
<li>The Continental Congress have a secret meeting where they decide that the country's official joke state will be New Jersey. The four ask the Congress for help on finding David Farnsworth, the counterfeiter. They point them to Benjamin Franklin's printing shop in Philadelphia.</li>
<li>The four arrive in Philadelphia by horse carriage to find out that David was Benjamin's apprentice, and that he ran away from him. They assume he must have escaped to Paul Revere's shop in Boston, since there weren't a lot of people in America then.</li>
<li>The five arrive in Boston by robot carriage to find David hiding in Paul's foundry. The Professor knocks him out hard (perhaps too hard) and they destroy the counterfeit money without using a lantern from the Old North Church, thus preventing the British from stopping the revolution.</li>
