<td align="left">Asgard (Aesgaard in comics)</td>
<td align="left">Dark Age Scandinavia. Ásgard is the home of the Æsir in Norse mythology. Howard states that the Baltic Sea would, post-cataclysm, divide his fictional Asgard into the modern Norway, Sweden, and Denmark according to The Hyborian Age essay.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Border Kingdoms</td>
<td align="left">Geographically located over the modern German Baltic Sea coast. A lawless region full of savages. Conan once traveled through the Border Kingdoms on his way to Nemedia. He befriended Mar the Piper and the King of the Border Kingdoms. He helped save the kingdoms before returning to his quest in reaching Nemedia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Brythunia</td>
<td align="left">The continental homelands of the Angles and Saxons who invaded Great Britain, which is the origin of the name. Semantically, the name Brythunia is from the Welsh Brython, "Briton", derived from the same root as the Latin Brito, Britannia, although Howard stated that the name was kept by the Æsir and Nemedians who settled there. The land is depicted geographically over modern Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Cimmeria</td>
<td align="left">Howard states in The Hyborian Age that "the Gaels, ancestors of the Irish and Highland Scots, descended from pure-blooded Cimmerian clans." He correlates Cimmeria with the Cymric people, Cimbri, Gimirrai, Scythians, Cimmerians, and the Crimea. Geographically located over modern Ireland, Scotland, and England.[c] The name is derived from the Greek legends of a northern people, who lived in perpetual mist and darkness near the Land of the Dead.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Hyperborea</td>
<td align="left">Finland, Russia, and the Baltic countries (Hyperborea). Is a land in the "outermost north" according to Greek historian Herodotus. Howard describes his Hyperborea as the first Hyborian kingdom, "which had its beginning in a crude fortress of boulders heaped to repel tribal attack".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Vanaheim</td>
<td align="left">Dark Age Scandinavia. Vanaheim is the home of the Vanir in Norse mythology. The red-haired vanir will finally oust the evil aristocracy of Stygia and found pharaonic Egypt. They are red-haired because an old Egyptian legend mentions that Egypt was founded by "red haired" strangers from outside.</td>
