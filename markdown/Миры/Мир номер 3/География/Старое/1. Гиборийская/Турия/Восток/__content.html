<tr>
<td align="left">Aquilonia</td>
<td align="left">A cross between the Roman Empire and Carolingian Empire. The name is borrowed from Aquilonia, a city of Southern Italy, between modern Venosa and Benevento; it is also an ancient name of Quimper and resembles that of Aquitaine, a French region ruled by England for a long portion of the Middle Ages. The name is derived from Latin aquilo(n–), "north wind". In Italian, aquila means also "eagle" that is the sign used in war by Roman Legion as well as the Aquilonian army.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Argos</td>
<td align="left">Various seafaring traders of the Mediterranean. The name comes from the Argo, ship of the Argonauts; or perhaps from the city of Argos, Peloponnesos, reputedly the oldest city in Greece, situated at the head of the Gulf of Argolis near modern Nafplion. Also, hints of Italy in regards to the indigenous population's appearance, names and culture.[b] In Hyborian Age cartography, Argos takes on the shape of a "shoe" in its border boundaries as compared to Italy appearing as a "boot". The coastal city of Messantia/Massantia derives its name from Massalia, the name given to Marseilles by its Greek founders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Corinthia</td>
<td align="left">Ancient Greece. From Corinth (Korinthos), a rich city in Classical Greece. Possibly suggested to Howard by the Epistles to the Corinthians, or by the region of Carinthia.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Koth</td>
<td align="left">From the ancient Hittites (the name Koth may come from the fact that the Hittites are called in the Bible the children of Heth, and the Egyptians called their land Kheta). The Kothian capital of Khorshemish corresponds to Carchemish, capital of a Neo-Hittite kingdom. Perhaps from The Sign of Koth in The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath by H. P. Lovecraft.[g] Howard also used the same name in his interplanetary novel Almuric.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Nemedia</td>
<td align="left">A cross between Rome and Byzantium. Nemedia is the rival of Aquilonia (which corresponds to the Carolingians), and depended on Aesir mercenaries for their defence (as the Byzantine Empire hired Vikings as the Varangian Guard). The name comes from Nemed, leader of colonists from Scythia to Ireland in Irish mythology.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Ophir</td>
<td align="left">Ancient Ophir, a gold-mining region in the Old Testament, possibly on the shores of the Red Sea or the Arabian Sea (e.g. western Arabia), though clearly Howard saw it as situated somewhere in Italy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Pictish Wilderness</td>
<td align="left">Pre-Columbian America, with an overlay of North America during the European colonization of the Americas, possibly even colonial-era New York. Howard bestows names from the Iroquoi language on many of his Hyborian-Age Picts (but not the quasi-historical Picts featuring Bran Mak Morn).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Shem</td>
<td align="left">Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and Arabia. In the Bible, Shem is Noah's eldest son, the ancestor of the Hebrews, Arabs and Assyrians; hence, the modern "Semite" and Semitic languages (via Greek Sem), used properly to designate the family of languages spoken by these peoples.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Turan</td>
<td align="left">Persian name for Turkestan. A Turkish land, possibly referring to the Gokturk Empire, the Timurid Empire, or the Seljuk Empire. The name derives from Turan, the areas of Eurasia occupied by speakers of Ural–Altaic languages. The names of the various Turanian cities (e.g. Aghrapur, Sultanapur, Shahpur) are often in Persian language. King Yezdigerd is named after Yazdegerd III, ruler of the Sassanid Empire.[l] The city of Khawarizm takes its name from Khwarezm, and Khorusun from Khorasan.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Zamora</td>
<td align="left">The Romani people. The name comes from the city of Zamora, Zamora province, Castile-León, Spain, alluding to the Gitanos of Spain (see Zingara for discussion); or possibly it is based on the word "Roma". There may also be some reference to southern Italy, as Zamorans dance the tarantella in honor of their Spider-Gods (variously known as Omm and Zath). Also hints of Ancient Israel and Palestine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">Zingara</td>
<td align="left">Spain/Portugal. Iberian Peninsula as a whole. Zingara is also Italian for "Gypsy woman"; this may mean that Howard mixed up the source names of Zingara and Zamora, with Zingara originally meant to apply to the Roma kingdom, and Zamora to the Spanish kingdom.</td>
