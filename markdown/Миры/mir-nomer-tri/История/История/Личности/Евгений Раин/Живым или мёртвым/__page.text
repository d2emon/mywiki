!! Живым или мёртвым (Рассекречено в 110)

В мире происходят загадочные убийства, исчезновения самолетов, похищения техники и разных видов устройств, связанных с атомной энергетикой. Евгений Раин-младший и его коллеги из организации «Кампус» считают, что за этими событиями стоит исламская террористическая организация, возглавляемая Эмиром. Задача «Кампуса» — найти штаб-квартиру.

In his retirement, Ryan is living easy with a net worth over $80 million. He is working on two versions of his memoirs, one for immediate release, and another detailing his CIA career, to be published posthumously. However, he becomes increasingly frustrated with the direction in which President Kealty is taking the country, although he is initially publicly silent. Ultimately, he announces that he will come out of retirement to run for a second full term as President as a Republican candidate. Despite having originally not being involved in the Campus's activities due to his high-profile status, he gradually becomes more directly linked to the Campus's operations, aiding them from behind the scenes on occasion. Here, Ryan learns his elder son, Jack Jr., is a field operative of the Campus.
