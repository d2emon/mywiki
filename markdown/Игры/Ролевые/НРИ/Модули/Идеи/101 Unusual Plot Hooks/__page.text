When they leave the ruined town with the trinket, the town becomes whole, filled with people, and bustling with commerce.

As they stand in what was once the village square, a messenger from the town arrives and demands that they return the trinket at once.

* 4. The adventurers are minding their own business when they're approached by a desperate man who calls them "your majesties" and expresses shock and horror when they explain they've never seen him before. He says "Unbelievable. I'm the only one that got away from them."

* 6. Townsfolk mysteriously lose the ability to speak excepts in rhyme, and cannot in rhyme describe the cause after describing it as orange.

* 14. Very shortly after the party set foot in a strange new land, they see a ragged man being chased towards them by a huge mob. If they join in and kill him, they make peaceful contact with the locals. If they do nothing, then the ragged guy gets away and the heroes find out that they just committed a capital crime by not immediately doing everything in their power to kill him. For the rest of their time there, they have to deal with being high-profile fugitives. If they defend him, then a few villagers get away and essentially the same thing happens.

* 18. The adventurers wake up one morning and are shocked to find that each one of them is obese, as if they'd been transformed in the middle of the night. When they question other people about it, they have no reaction, as if the adventurers have always been monstrously fat, even when that shouldn't be possible, whether because of a lifetime of hard physical training to be a great fighter or the impressively fast metabolism of an elf. But the next morning, the adventurers are back to normal. When they question people if they'd looked or acted differently yesterday, they get the same response, that nothing out of the ordinary happened at all.[[<<]]A few weeks pass without incident, but one morning the adventurers awake to find that this time, they've all become undead. What makes this even more disturbing is that, other people not only claim nothing changed when questioned by the adventurers (who have to truss and coerce as people now run in fear of them), and once again, they return to normal the next day, people they interrogated not even seeming to remember being chased and questioned by a pack of revenants.[[<<]]When will the next change occur? What will it be? What is causing this and why? And how can it be stopped?
* 19. While resting in a tavern, the adventurers meet and enjoy the fellowship of a friendly and gregarious person. During the course of the evening, their new friend interacts with the tavern's other patrons (asks the guy at the next table for the salt, etc.). The next morning, the gregarious fellow has vanished, and when the adventurers inquire to his whereabouts, they are informed that they dined alone, and that no such fellow exists. Searching the tavern common room, they come across some item (a monogrammed glove, a ring inscribed with the fellow's name) that is evidence the fellow was there the night before.
* 20. The PCs have a failed, and a cult they were fighting has succeeded at bringing back an ancient, sealed villain from the dead. He immediately kills the cult that has resurrected him and explains to the PCs that hell is not a nice place, and he wants to make amends before he dies again. This is, of course, made all the more difficult by his vicious reputation (he was, after all, one of the greatest evils the world has ever known).
* 21. As 18, but instead of the PCs changing for a day, they are the only ones who DON'T change, and when they ask people what happened to them, they claim that nothing has and whatever feature the change effected was always like that.
* 22. The PCs find themselves in possession of a large pile of coins that they can't identify. There are no images or languages from any country that could mint money that they resemble. Once the apparent value is determined, though, they begin spending them. Several weeks later, however, they find that anyone whom they've given that money to has changed recently, becoming increasingly beautiful. While this is strange, it doesn't become serious until the recipients of the coins become icons of physical perfection. Then they start turning into stone.
* 23. Number of cloaked figures in masks walks into an inn and starts murdering people. One man runs away and they chase after him. Once they catch him, they take unusual ring from his finger and murder him. Then dm says this[[<<]][>All of you take off the masks. You're standing over a dead body, one of you is holding wierd ring in hand. You have vague recognition of the fact you have killed this man and other people to get it, but you don't know why.

* 26. The PCs all start out in different parts of the world and realize they can telepathically communicate with each other, but have no idea why or how.
* 27. The PCs suddenly become aware that their world is a roleplaying game, and they are actually from a higher reality that got trapped in the game somehow. They remember nothing about their real selves, and have to find out why they are trapped in the game.
* 28. The party accidentally free an eldritch horror from his prison. He's ecstatic, and promises to be their best friend. While not particularly helpful (since fully manifesting in the world would probably destroy it, and that would be rude), he's completely harmless- except that townsfolk are mistrusting or hostile to him being around, and he won't stop talking.
* 29. A high artifact attaches itself to the Party. It cannot be destroyed or lost and everyone else in the country recognizes enough to avoid it. At random intervals it messes with them, turning their gear bright colors, making their pack animals sentient and indignant, body swapping, making them (temporarily?) kobolds, etc, although never anything deadly.
* 30. The entire 'verse is mismatched in a single night, causing pretty much everything to be mixed up and scattered. Suddenly coastal cities are in the desert, half of the desert is under the ocean, there's an ocean in a circle of Hell, and another is on the back of a colossus. And practically no one is what they were before.
* 31. The party accidentally becomes the target of a summoning spell of a few mages in another dimension.
* 32. The PCs are rookie starship techs working for a major corporation. Their boss sends them out to a deep-space station which doesn't appear on any maps, where the corporation is secretly developing a wormhole generation device. Their ship is crippled by gravitational distortion on the way in, and once aboard the station they find that the crew has gone mad. Worse, the wormhole generator explodes within an hour, killing everyone aboard... and the PCs find themselves back in the hangar. Time has been reset to the moment they boarded the station. Cue a Groundhog Day-type scenario: the PCs have only an hour to fix the station before it explodes, but they return to the start of that hour when they die. The station's occupants have gone insane from continually experiencing their own deaths, so the PCs have to figure out a way to fix the wormhole drive within a certain number of "cycles" or take increasing sanity penalties. They'll need to accumulate information over multiple cycles to have a chance.
* 33. There's a significant threat to the kingdom emerging, and the PCs are tasked with finding the ancient hero that founded the kingdom before disappearing claiming he'd return in its hour of need. Most would consider this a wild-goose chase except that he HAS returned before, defending the kingdom from some great evil before vanishing again. The PCs finally find a crypt and are dismayed to find the hero is dead. Only his sword remains, a weapon whose powers allegedly only awakened for him. When they pick up the sword, however, they find its powers work just fine. It WILL only work for its master, though, and so it begins to slowly turn the PC that bears it into a copy of him, changing appearances and even gender, and replacing his/her memories with the hero's. It turns out this is why the hero was seemingly able to return from the dead to protect the kingdom. Those returns were actually replacements. Can the PCs stop the threat before the sword completely erases what their friend once was?
* 34. The PCs, who don't know each other and are possibly even from different cities/countries, all suddenly wake up in stasis pods in a strange facility. The place is recently abandoned, as if in a hurry. While searching for the exit, the PCs find evidence that each of them was snatched up five years previously and has since been living their life in virtual reality.
* 35: After traveling through a thick, swampy, bug-infested bog, the PCs begin going through some physical changes. Bright light begins to bother their eyes, and in time irritate their skin. Food tastes off, and the party becomes perpetually thirsty and irritable. Any death or slaughter in their vicinity causes them to need a series of slowly-increasing Will saves to avoid rushing forward and frantically consuming the gore. Yep, they're all afflicted with vampirism - as the mosquitos in the bog had fed on a freshly-full vampire and transmitted the disease through their own bites.
* 36: As the PCs are resting in a town, frequent heavy rainfall bursts a nearby dam and floods the town and surrounding region in five feet of water. People are trapped inside their houses, and things are moving in the slow, gurgling water.
* 37: When the PC's ship is docked at a remote space station, a number of inexplicable technical faults serve to make exiting the place impossible. The docking clamps have cold-fused to the ship; the harbor computers keep shutting off every five minutes; holes appear in the boarding platform hull; coolant leaks freeze all nonmetallic material that enters the bay in seconds. These are caused by an obsessed superfan who has been following the PCs' daring space adventures for the whole of the campaign. He has their action figures and all their news reports taped, which he watches every night. He will not let them leave until they agree to be his friend.
* 38: The PCs meet an old woman tending a roadside shop. She attempts to hawk treasure maps; an inspection will reveal that each one leads to one of the PC's family homes. Should they return, they will find a previously unseen and unknown door directly beneath the bed they slept in as children, leading to the exaggerated realms of dragons, princesses, dark knights of evil and glorious victories of good that they fantasized about before going to sleep each night.
* 39: The PCs arrive at an isolated, idyllic forest village. While there, they recognize people who they know to have died - lost parents, murdered siblings, foul villains who died by their own hands. None have any memory of what the PCs have seen, and they all claim to have never left the village.
* 40: To complete a mission, the PCs must make an extended underwater jaunt. The potions they purchase to allow them to breathe underwater work like a charm - except now they can't breathe air anymore. The secret lies somewhere deep under the waves.

To make matters worse they where already on a quest to defeat a great evil and two weeks is not nearly enough time to finish that task. Will the PCs try to cheat death or will they instead try to finish their heroic quest in the few days they have left?
* 44) The PCs are avatars in an MMO. They have real life people who play the game behind them and it is totally clear and apparent that the fantasy world is just one big videogame. The "real life" people, however, are not real at all, but rather thoughts implanted in the PC's head by some unknown force. In reality the world is not an MMO at all but an actual fantasy world. However, for some reason this world is seemingly dictated by MMO rules and the people all believe they are actually players controlling Avatars, with the thoughts, memories ect.. to go with it. As time goes on, however, strange things start happening, and eventually the PCs may find out the hidden truth of their world and what mysterious force has caused their home and minds to act in accordance with the MMO myth.
