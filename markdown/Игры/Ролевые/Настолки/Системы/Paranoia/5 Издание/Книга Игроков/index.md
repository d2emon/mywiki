trees and wildlife, but the characters they are playing have lived underground all their lives and have just emerged from a heavily-guarded security door into the light of day.
Dan (GM) (consulting his notes and laying a map before the players): Well, this is a rough sketch ofwhat you see as you emerge from the security door. A narrow path leads away from the door. Everything around you is unimaginably bizarre — green stuff everywhere, none of it with any apparent function; tall brown poles with more green stuff on top ...
Ken: Um. Trees, I suppose ...
Dan: Now, now, we Troubleshooters have never seen trees before, have we?
Ken: Oh, right. I get it.
Dan: And another thing. No ceiling. Repeat, no ceiling.
Eric: Gahhhh! No ceiling?!
Dan: Right. Now, what do our intrepid agents do?
Eric: I scream, clutch the door jamb, and try to squeeze back inside.
Greg: I take notes. (Greg's agent is a secret spy for Internal Security, and the notes are being taken on the scandalous behavior of the new agents.)
Lori: I join Eric's character scrabbling at the door.
Ken: I pull my laser and try to look competent. (Ken's character's Secret Society mission is to assassinate Greg. Ken's Secret Society, Death Leopard, has discovered the secret identity of the Internal Security agent and is looking for an opportunity to scrag him.)
Dan: Very good. Eric and Lori, there are four tough Internal Security officers with wicked-looking projectile weapons blocking your return through the door. Ken, are you pointing that laser at anyone or anything in particular?
Ken: Nope. Just in case something comes out ofthe trees ... er, out ofthe green stuff. Dan: Okay. Eric? Lori? About the guards with heavy ordinance?
Lori: I sober up real quick ...
Eric: Me, too.
Lori: ... and I back away from the door.
Dan: Good. The door closes abruptly with a hiss and a click.
Greg: C'mon, agents. We have a service to perform for The Computer and you are disgracing yourselves.
Lori: I salute and begin crawling down the path.
Eric: Crawling?
Lori: Of course! I feel better close to the floor. (Peering at her hands.) Gee, it's dirty. Don't the scrubots ever come out here?
Greg: Disgraceful.
Ken: Eric, when your character dies, can I have his binoculars?
Dan: How interesting that you should mention binoculars. Because something seems to be approaching very quickly from high above the brown-and-green stuff. It vaguely resembles a transbot, but is much faster, and flying.
Eric: Flying?
Lori: I've got a bad feeling about this.
Dan: Worse yet, a tiny brown creature with a long hairy tail is watching you from the
brown-and-green stuff.
Eric: Eek! An alien!
Dan: A very likely hypothesis. It is holding a tiny oval brown object which could be a
communicator.
Ken: I burn it immediately with my laser, which, I proudly note, is ready for immediate use, as stated so cleverly earlier.
... and an innocent squirrel is speedily dispatched by our hero. As for the fate of the
agents, you are left to speculate.

8.	Choose your remaining skills as described in the section "Skill Assignment" below.
9.	Get your gamemaster to help you determine ifyou have a mutant power and what it is.
10.	Get your gamemaster to help you determine ifyou are in a Secret Society and what that society is.
11.	Ask the gamemaster what equipment and credits your Troubleshooter can have, then whine and grovel until the gamemaster gives you a little more or tells you to shut the hell up.
The explanations for each of these steps are listed below.
f, PREPARAT/OA/
Get a pencil, ten-sided die, and something you can use as a character sheet. Go ahead, I'll wait.
Z PARAMO/A NAMES
"Rupert the Barbarian."
"Sir Spastic El Sidney."
"Marcus Leadenbottom."
"Elvira the Dire."
"Bob."
Any ofthe above names could be suitable for any roleplaying game not nearly as interesting as Paranoia. No, in Alpha Complex, there is a system for everything — especially for naming clones.
Your Troubleshooter's name is created from a complex and delicate system that will tell the right person everything there is to know about your clone. Every ability, every psychological advantage and flaw, and even secret stuff that nobody should know about — even the clone himself — is recorded in the clone's own name designation.
Unfortunately, the "right person" never seems to come along in Alpha Complex. So, here's how the name works.
THE SURNAME
When you address the Computer, you usu¬ally say, "Yes, sir!" or something to that effect. Likewise, when you don't know the name of a higher security clearance clone — or any clone who seems to be better armed than you are — you use the "sir" designation. Why is this?
Nobody knows. There is no sexism in Alpha Complex (probably because there's no sex), so "sir" is a generic term to mean "somebody im¬portant whose name I either don't know or am afraid to speak for fear of A) mispronouncing it and getting myselfbeaten or shot or B) breath¬ing in his/her/Its presence and getting myself beaten or shot." "Sir," then, is a self-defense mechanism used to take the place of the first part of a clone's name.
The first part of a clone's name can be virtu¬ally anything. Sure, there's some sort of system by which these things are assigned, but nobody knows it, except the Computer (who really as- 
RED CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY RED-CLEARANCE CITIZENS
signs the names — the players just get to so the gamemaster doesn't have to think them all up). Long or short, complicated or non-, they can be anything.
Тне SecuRfTY CUARANCR
In the middle of every Alpha Complex name is the character's security clearance. All clones are addressed by at least their surname and security clearance at all times — that's the rule. Technically, they are supposed to be addressed by their full names at all times, but the Computer hasn't been enforcing that as often as It could.
Infrared clearance clones, as mentioned before, have no security clearance, so no "middle name." All other clones do. I hear tell that, in the Old Reckoning (the days before the Computer ... a real long time ago), some clones were embarrassed by their middle names. Well, IR clones are really embarrassed — and inconvenienced — by their lack of middle name, and lower-clearance clones don't seem too eager to spout out their security clearances to higher-level clones either.
R = Red
0	= Orange
Y	= Yellow
G = Green
B = Blue
1	= Indigo
V	= Violet
U = Ultraviolet
This part ofthe character's name will change from time to time. That's why, at the top of the Character Sheet, there's a list of all the known security clearances. Just circle the appropriate one in pencil so you can change it when necessary.
Номе SecroR Des/ештюм
Even though all Troubleshooters are brought together to Troubleshooter Headquar¬ters, they all come from somewhere. Most clones are breached, live, and die in the same sector the Computer assigned them. Troubleshooters are lucky; they get to travel and see the wonders of Alpha Complex.
To catalog all clones, it was decided (by the Computer, naturally) that the last name of every clone would be a three-letter designation specifying that clone's sector of origin. Since Alpha Complex is huge, there are many, many sectors, so virtually any combination of letters is possible. "DED" sector, "ABC" sector, "QED" sector, etc.
CiOA/e Л/имвее
After the clone's last name is that clone's number. All Troubleshooters, unless otherwise specified by the gamemaster, start at clone number 1. They proceed through clones 2, 3, 4; 5, and 6 as fast or slow as their lifecycles take them (what time is it? Mark off a clone number) and, when they mark off number six, it's time to assign a new Troubleshooter. Again, since this clone number will change as often (or more often) as a character's security clearance, there's another line on the Character Sheet that you can use to circle and erase clone numbers.
PUTTING IT AU ToeemeR
Choose a first name, assign the correct security clearance (probably Red), and choose a sector of origin (remember, only three letters). If the gamemaster is kind, you can then
put a "1" at the end. Here are some common examples of Alpha Complex names:
Lepp-R-OUS-1
Slip-R-EEE-1
Dead-R-BOY-1
Nev-R-LAT-1
Ready-R-NOT-1
Of course, Troubleshooters may go up in clearance, or they could lose clones, so their names could end up somewhat different:
Jean Claude-V-DAM-3 Grouch-O-MRX-2 Wood-I-ALN-6 Oh-G-WIZ-5
As you can tell, great care and serious thought goes into the creation of a Paranoia character's name.

3 ATTRIBUTE GEA/ERAT/OA/
There are eight basic attributes every character has: Strength, Agility, Dexterity, Endurance, Moxie, Chutzpah, Mechanical Aptitude, and Power. Each has a different use in the game.
Strength is the character's physical power and is directly related to how much he can lift and carry, and how much damage he does in hand-to-hand combat. A character with a Strength of 10 is hugely powerful, while a Strength 1 character has a hard time pulling
open a slightly-stuck door.
Agility is the attribute that governs how physically coordinated the clone is, and how well she can balance (not how "well-balanced" — clones are anything but well-balanced). An Olympic-level gymnast probably has a 10, while Mr. Geek who trips over carpet-lint
is around a 1.
Dexterity is hand-eye coordination. Mr. Geek, above, might trip over imaginary, deceased, invisible turtles, but he might also be a whiz with his hands. Surgeons and fine technicians — not to mention gunfighters — have fine motor coordination and probably 10 Dexterities. If you have a lot of trouble finding and holding onto your keys in broad daylight (the drop-clink-kick thing goes on around your front door a lot), you're closing in on a 1 Dexterity.
Endurance measures the character's ability to resist damage and fatigue. A guy with a 10 can be shot, tortured, and beat up and still move. A clone with a 1 Endurance folds when the corridor fans get set on "high." Endurance is also good for resisting diseases and radiation poisoning (not that these ever happen in Alpha Complex).
Moxie is kind of like intelligence, but that might be stretching the point for an Alpha Complex clone. Figuring things out and comprehending unusual phenomena is more the right definition. Wit is also covered under Moxie. A scientist would have a high Moxie, but so would a really good stand-up comedian. A person who is consistently surprised when a streetlight turns a different color (and then gets run down because she can't remember what that means) has a low Moxie.
Chutzpah is plain bluster, guts and a little bit of psychology. A clone who can walk into a higher security clearance area, slap around a High Programmer and walk out again, then bold-facedly lie to the Computer about what happened (and get away with it) has a high Chutzpah — probably around a 30, for this example, but you get the point. Someone who can't talk their way out of a littering (like dropping an applefruitlyke core into a garbage can and having it roll out a hole in the bottom) has a low Chutzpah.
Mechanical Aptitude measures a character's ability to operate and, to some extent, understand machines in Alpha Complex. Nobody really knows how things work in Alpha — they just glomb them together the way everybody else has. A character with a high MechApt has a better chance of getting that toaster working without electrocuting himself than most clones. Someone who has a hard time changing a light bulb (read: BZZZZT!) has a low score in this attribute.
Power is used for one thing and one thing only: Control ofyour mutant power (ifyou have one). Ifyou are assigning attributes instead of rolling them, don't worry too much about this attribute — few clones actually have mutant powers, right? Oh, Power is used for understanding the workings of your mutant power as well.
PlAVMG WITH we A/UMBSRS
There are two ways you can generate your attributes: randomly and by point allocation. Point allocation is good for players who like to feel they have considerable control over how their characters turn out, while random attribute generation is for people who just want a quick, easy method.
It is up to the gamemaster which system you use. Ask her now which one she prefers. Use it and stop whining.
Random Allocation: Roll one ten-sided die for each attribute, in order. After you've done this, decide whether you would like to risk rerolling any one attribute ofyour choice. Ifyou reroll an attribute, though, youmust take the second result—even if it is lower than the first.
Add up the numeric values ofyour attributes. Ifyou have less than 40 points, you have a fairly pathetic character. Ifyou want, whine and moan to your gamemaster and try to

Roll IdlO on the following table to determine what Service Group your character was in before joining the Troubleshooters.
SERVTCE GROUPS AA/D SK/US
Depending on what Service Group the T roubleshooter is from, she will get a chance to learn a different combi¬nation of skills as part of her Service Group training.
Every member of every Service Group is given basic training in some skills important to that particular Service Group. To determine what your character has learned as part of her Service Group, simply find the table that corresponds to her Service Group and rollfive times, recording the results on your character sheet.
Note: Troubleshooters who rolled that they were agents ofInternal Security roll three times on the "IntSec" skill chart and twice on the chart of the Service Group they rolled as their "cover."

*If Internal Security is rolled, roll again, ignoring this result. The character is an IntSec agent posing as a member of another Service Group (the second one rolled).
 

IntSec is the best. I started out learning some spy skills, then I went into "deep cover" as an R&D tech. I didn't pick up much there — maybe that's why I ended up blowing up that lab ...

When you have finished rolling the dice, move on to "8. Choosing Your Skills" and finish fleshing out your Troubleshooter's knowledge.
8 CHOOSWG YOUR Smis
You have learned (hopefully) some skills from your individual Service Group(s), and now you can pick some skills you might have liked to learn but couldn't.
You have ten skill points. Each skill point can buy you one rank in any skill on the Paranoia Skill List (next chapter). There are a few rules to skill selection, however.
1.	You may not buy skill ranks in any skill that already has five (or more) skill ranks.
2.	You must spend all your skill points now; no saving for later.
SKILL RANKS AND SK/U BASES
As mentioned above, your skill bases represent the basic abilities your character has in every skill underneath each attribute. The skill ranks you learned during your Service Group training are added to those skill bases to determine your character's skill value. Any skills you buy with skill points are also added on to the skill base.
Example: Mage-R-GUF was in the R&D Service Group before joining the Troubleshooters. He learned several skills, including biosciences, which he learned at two ranks. Biosciences is aMoxie skill, soMage-Rgets to add his two ranks to his Moxie skill base (which happens to be three). So, he has biosciences 5.
Then, during this step, he chooses to increase his biosciences skill some more. For one point, he can buy one additional skill rank, making his bioscience skill value a 6. This does not affect his overall skill base, but it does make him better at biosciences.
9, Mum/т POWERS
"Now is the time for all good clones to turn their minds to treason ..."
Well, maybe not treason, but close to it. Okay, drag your gamemaster away from whatever he or she is doing and tell him or her that you need some help with your character. If possible, go off to a separate room with the gamemaster to do this. Yes, that's what all the other players have been doing... no, they probably weren't conspiring against you. Well, maybe they were, but that's beside the point.
On the back ofyour character sheet is where you record your "secret stuff — like your mutant power (ifyou have one) and your secret society (next step; let's not get ahead of ourselves).
You'll need to roll a twenty-sided die and tell the gamemaster what you get. The gamemaster has a chart (later in this book—it's secret and Ultraviolet clearance, so don't you dare look!) that will tell him ifyou have a mutant power and what it is.
Ifyou have a mutant power, the gamemaster will probably ask you to make a "power" roll right now. Don't worry about how that works,.he'll let you know. Ifyou succeed, he'll tell you about your power (as much as you know, anyway). Ifyou fail, you'll be lucky to get a name out ofhim. Record the name where it says "Mutant Power" on the sheet.
Ifyou don't have a mutant power, then record that as well. Whew! You don't have to worry about the rest ofthis section; you can skip to Step 10.
WHAT MUTANT POWERS ARE
According to rumor (rumors, by the way, are treason, but, then, so are mutant powers ...), mutant powers are "mistakes" that result from faulty cloning. Some clone families get weird special abilities that nobody else in Alpha Complex has. They allow you to do things no one else can do, see things no one else can see ... the whole spiel.
They also allow you to get zapped as a traitor ifyou aren't careful.
You see, most mutant powers, unless used with extreme care, are dangerous to the user as well. Oh, I'm not saying your clone is going to blow himselfup with his mutant power the first time he uses it (though that could happen) — but the friendly clones of Alpha Complex, especially the clone's teammates, will probably do that for him.
Remember what's treasonous in Alpha? The Computer says mutant powers are bad. Use 'em and get caught, and you get recycled as defective. Your next clone pops up, hopefully with this little DNA glitch removed. 
RED CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY RED-CLEARANCE CITIZENS
CAM f Amo Tws?
It would be a short game if there were no ways to avoid getting caught and executed as a traitor. If you have a mutant power, there are three things you can do:
1.	Hide the Power, Hide the Power, Hide the Power That Rules: See, ifyou use the power, you could get caught. Ifyou use the power, you might like it, which might make you use it more, which will eventually get you caught. Maybe the best thing to do is forget you have it and never, ever use it.
2.	Don’t Play the Sap for Nobody, See: Hey, you can confess. Mutant powers are treason, but if you turn your self in, the Computer is likely to be lenient with you. Most likely, you'lljust get your yellow mutant registration stripe and be told to go out and Sin
No More.
3.	Be Discreet; Stay Alive: Okay, so you don't want to abandon this neat-and-wifty ability, but you don't want to have to proclaim to the world "Hey, I'm a low-life, scummy
mutant!" Well, you can split the difference: Only use your mutant power when you are sure nobody will notice (and be able to report on you) ... and, if you do get caught, try to fast talk your way to an epiphany. "By the Computer, what was that?! I've never seen that happen before!"
The approach you take is up to you.
fO. DETERMWE SECRET SOC/ETV
While you've got your gamemaster's attention, see ifhe will let you roll a twenty-sided die again and check for a Secret Society. Ifyou get one, keep reading; otherwise, skip to the next step.
SecRiT Soc/ету MEMBERSHIP
Most Troubleshooters start at the lowest rank of their Secret Society, but can work their way up quickly. All Secret Societies have different rules and mantras and such; obeying them will get you promoted. Since Troubleshooters are in such a "forward" position (compared to the guys who work in the cafeteria or clean out the Johns), they have more opportunity for advancement within their societies as well.
If you get a Secret Society, chances are good the gamemaster will tell you quite a bit about it, and maybe even tell you a mission or two you can accomplish to go up in rank. The gamemaster has a whole chapter on the different Secret Societies of Alpha Complex that you can't read to learn more. Sorry about that; Ultraviolet clearance and all that.
SIAPS AMO BEMM/ES
"Slaps" are bad things; "bennies" are good things. Just about every Secret Society has them. A "slap" might mean the Computer is extra angry when it finds out about clones being a member ofthis Secret Society, while a "bennie" could mean clones of a particular Secret Society start out with extra skills or stuff. The gamemaster knows which Secret Societies get what slaps and which bennies, so ask what you get.
// £QU/PMEA/T, Srt/fEi AA/D A/OA/SEA/SE
All things in Alpha Complex belong to the Complex and are distributed by the Computer's need and whim. However, the Computer often rewards clones with "personal" property — sure, it belongs to the Complex, but the Computer says you can keep it and do what you want with it (other than wilfully destroying it — destroying Computer property without permission or a damn good reason is treason).

RED CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY RED-CLEARANCE CITIZENS 
To simulate ability mixed with luck in a roleplaying game, there is almost always some sort of system for determining whether or not your character succeeds or fails when he or she tries to accomplish something. In Paranoia, when your character tries to do something, he is performing a skill check.
The gamemaster has most ofthe details on skill checks, but here's the gist: Y ou tell the gamemaster you want to try to do something, he tells you what skill (or skill base) you're using. Y ou tell him what your skill value is (the skill base plus any ranks you have in the skill) and you roll a twenty-sided die. Tell him what you got, and he'll tell you what happened.
Simple, no?
Well, not necessarily. See, the gamemaster has this chart ("Master Skill Check Chart") that he checks to see whether you succeed or fail. You can't see it, because it is — guess what? — in the Ultraviolet section of this book. Sorry.
Anyway, he determines how easy or how difficult it is for you to perform a particular action (how does he do this? Ifyou were meant to know, we'd tell you) and then cross¬references that level of difficulty with your skill value to determine what you need to roll.
Why does this matter? Well, because it is a lot easier to use your laser weapons skill to shoot at an unmoving, man-sized target than, say, a tin can flying through the air — or another clone, for that matter. Sometimes, you have a skill value of 10 and you roll an eight and succeed. Sometimes, you fail. Sometimes it rains ...
Obscure movie reference. Never mind.
What this means is, don't expect consistency. Sure, the higher the skill value you have the better (keep improving those skills), but very few things are a certainty ... and you don't always know how hard something is to do until you try it.

As mentioned previously, there are three different types of skills: General, Service Group, and Life in Alpha Complex. The skills in this chapter are not organized by these categories. Instead, they are organized by attribute. So, all Agility-based skills are listed together, as are all Dexterity, Chutzpah, and Mechanical Aptitude skills.
We Smt l/srwes
Each skill has a Skill Name, and a Description. The name is easy — laser weapons is the name ofthe skill you use to fire a laser weapon. Hard, huh?
The description is a brief summation of what the skill does. Some skills aren't self¬explanatory : laser weapons is easy to figure out, but maybe not spurious logic or biosciences.
The descriptions are briefbecause, hey, this is the Red clearance section, dunsel; you aren't cleared for any more information. The gamemaster has the important information — like special rules and modifiers — in the Ultraviolet section of the rulebook.

MORF S*/U STUFF
Okay, so you've spent your skill points and rolled for your Service Group skills. Is that all the skills you'll ever get?
Probably not. The gamemaster will give you opportunities to learn new skills and improve the ones you have, sometimes during adventures, most often between adven¬tures . So you stink at most ofyour skills now—so what? That gives you something to work toward.
UARMWG Mew Smis
When your Troubleshooter learns new skills or improves old skills is completely up to the gamemaster — but here are the guidelines we recommend.
At the end of each adventure — or during a significant break during a long adventure — you get to pick two skills of any type and the gamemaster picks two skills of any type. You roll 1d20, trying to roll equal to or higher than your current skill value (your skill ranks plus your attribute value). Ifyou roll equal to or higher than one of the skills you chose, you can then increase that skill's rank by one. You might succeed at both rolls and increase two skills by one rank each — or you might fail at both.
If you roll a one when checking for a skill increase, then you're in trouble. For some rea¬son — whether because you received a bad MemoMax transfer or you're a complete dink— you forgot something about the skill you were trying to improve. The skill goes down by one rank. Ifyou were trying to learn a new skill (one you have no ranks in), then there is no effect.
Likewise, ifyou only have one rank in the skill, there is no effect.
The gamemaster makes the same rolls for two other skills with the same effects. The gamemaster, by the way, is trying to choose skills that he thinks your character used a lot in the adventure or might have learned a lot about.
You are picking any skills you want to develop.
Example: Rote-O-RTE has just completed a mission of great importance for the Com¬puter. By tapping into a simplex computer- node, he was able to keep a Commie plot to

(RED CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY RED-CLEARANCE CITIZENS
blow up all of YEK-sector's sewage systems from succeeding (yay, Rote-O!)
The player decides he wants to try to in¬crease his brawling and dodge skills — he knows all adventures won't be as quiet as this one. He has an Agility skill base of 3 (both skills are Agility-based), and he has three ranks in brawling and two in dodge, for skill values of 6 and 5 respectively.
Rote-O rolls a 5 when he tries to improve his brawling skill and a 10 for his dodge. Since his brawling skill is a 6, Rote-O failed to improve that skill, but he made his dodge easily. Rote-O's dodge skill value goes up to 6.
The gamemaster decides Rote-O might have learned something about the skills data analysis and data search while messing around with the simplex’s computer node. Both are Moxie skills, and Rote-O has a Moxie skill base of 4. He has two skill ranks in data analysis but none in data search (he was using his skill base alone — lucky, eh?) So, the gamemaster needs to roll 4+2=6 or higher for Rote-O to improve his data analy¬sis skill and a 4 or higher for him to learn his first rank in data search.
The gamemaster rolls and — uh, oh — he gets a 1 on the die for the data analysis roll! MMMMMMM6000! OULY TH£	That means Rote-O learned something wrong along the way, or maybe he justforgot
S£ST SYMTAFFUD FROM PLC!	some basic principles — he loses one rank in data analysis, so his skill value is now
reduced to a five. The gamemaster gives Rote-O the bad news and rolls for the Troubleshooter's data search skill ... and gets another one. Fortunately, Rote-0 doesn’t have any skill ranks to lose in data search, so he just doesn t improve.
И/HAT Smcs CAM / UAAM?
Out in the "real world" of Alpha Complex, characters can learn any skills, up to a total skill value of20. Once your character's skill ranks plus his skill base equal 20, he can't get any better. He can, however, get worse ...

Welcome, Troubleshoooters! My name is Roy-G-BIV, and I will be acting as your First-time Indoctrinator, Liaison, and Theoretical Head¬master (FILTH). I will be giving you your introduction to the exciting field of Troubleshooting.
Bme A TkoueusHOoreR
I	was a Troubleshooter, once — I suppose I still am, even though I've been sitting at a desk for two yearcycles now. Ah, those where the days ... hunting the corridors of Alpha Complex for Commies, mutants, and traitors, and blasting the living vat out ofeverything that moved. Sigh. Ah, well, enough reminiscing.
The most important thing you have to remember about being a Troubleshooter is that you are the Computer's hands, eyes, and ears in Alpha Complex. Oh, sure, the Computer has bots o' plenty to be Its hands ... and millions of monitors and hidden microphones to be Its eyes and ears ... but you are Its first line of defense against Commie takeover. Well, It has the Armed Forces and IntSec, but that's beside the point. You are important.
Lots of other Service Groups will resent you and they may give you trouble from time to time ... trouble you might not be able to shoot. But, as a Troubleshooter, you need to rise above their petty envy and keep on keeping on.
PRCPARWG FOR COMPUTER M/ssfous
Every adventure starts with a mission briefing — that is, every adventure that the Computer wants you to go on. As a Troubleshooter, your life belongs to the Computer ... well, so does everybody else's, but that's not what I'm trying to say.
Let me put it this way. Every so often, the Computer will call you up or send a squad ofV ulture Troopers to abduct you from your creche and tell you It wants you to go on a mission for the good of Alpha Complex. As a Troubleshooter, you must obey. Your first duty is to report to the mission briefing area.
М/SSfOM BRfCfWGS
I'm gonna tell you this straight — sometimes the Computer likes to ... test Its Troubleshooters before the very, very important life-or-death mission begins. Sometimes, It will order you to report to the mission briefing area (where you will be assigned your mission), but It won't tell you where to go ... maybe knowledge of the area is classified, or perhaps the Computerjust wants to see how smartyou are. You must get to the mission briefing area or you have failed in your mission before it begins.
When you do arrive, you might be briefed by a high-level clone, a jackobot with a recorded message, the Computer Itself, or any one of a number ofbriefing-type officials. Some will give you mounds and mounds of paperwork to fill out before you can go on your 
mission; others will be brief and terse and very cryptic. Regardless, it is up to you to disseminate the information they give you and set out on your mission.
Veev /MPQBTAA/T kTUff
The next step is almost always a trip to the local PLC supply dump where your Troubleshooter team will be given whatever equipment the Computer thinks you'll need on your important mission. Sometimes getting to PLC can be a mini-adventure in and of itself (another test?) Sometimes, it's right next door.
Getting the proper equipment is always easy. The Computer has assigned PLC a list of tools, weapons, and accessories that the PLC clone will invariably give you. Of course, the clone probably won't let you see the list, but no clone would try to deceive you or betray the Computer by giving you faulty or erroneous equipment and selling the real stuff on the infrared market, now would they? Of course not.
AS ГОЛ/G AS VOU'RE GO/A/G Our...
Anyway, once you're loaded down with stuff, you have to head offto R&D. How you get there is usually up to you. R&D, though, is most often pretty easy to find —just smell the smoke and listen for the explosions.
The R&D lab is a great place to visit, yes, sir — especially if you are on a Computer mission. There, they will load you down with experimental and prototypical gadgets, weapons, armor, and accessories that you have been assigned for your upcoming mission, Most often, these paragons of science have been ordered to give their babies over to the Troubleshooters for testing — they might not have anything to do with the mission itself — and it is your responsibility to sign for everything and report how (and if) it works.
Sometimes, the R&D techs will ask for volunteers to test even more equipment. Usually, this stuffis fresh offthe laboratory chalkboard, and really neat! Unfortunately,
I never got the chance to test any of this stuff— I always seemed to be busy elsewhere when the R&D boys were asking for volunteers — but I got to see all the wifiy gizmos in operation! My erstwhile companions (may they rest in peace) proved themselves true heroes of Alpha Complex by volunteering for these testing assignments.
Ou Tt/E ROAD AGA/P
And now, without further ado, it is offto the actual mission! Ifyou haven't lost one or two clones yet, you haven't really been trying. No,just kidding (?); now the fun part begins, Head off down the corridors, singing a Troubleshooter marching song, and make ready to serve the Computer!
THe	M/ss/ом/tseu
There are hundreds of different types of missions you could be assigned to go on. All of them have two things in common, though: First, they are vitally important to the continued peace and prosperity ofAlpha Complex, and, second, they are all ordered by the Computer. To fail in a Computer mission is a Bad Thing ... unless you can pin down the blame on somebody else. Then, you have done the Computer an important service ... you have uncovered a traitor in the midst of the loyal Troubleshooter team.
Mfss/OA/s ГА/ ALPUA COMPLEX
Many adventures occur inside Alpha Complex. Some are "search and destroy" missions — like "The Trouble in Food Vat 10," where a mucus-spawned vat-creature came alive and tried to eat a whole regiment of PLC clones while they were overcome by nausea. Or then there was "Hide, Seek, Destroy!" where a group of Troubleshooters was told to masquer¬ade as infrared clones, search the underlevel transtube bays for Secret Society members, and burn them out. You might even get to go on a super-secret mission like "CLASSIFIED! GREEN CLEARANCE AUTHORIZATION ONLY!"
Oh, sorry; guess I can't tell you about that.
M/SS/OA/S Ш ROGUE SfMPLEXES
I know you've heard the rumors — the Computer has been monitoring you — and, though rumors are treason, I have to confirm these. Evil Secret Societies and mutants 
  
 

 
IRED CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR 'USE BY RED-CLEARANCE CITIZENS
have managed to — temporarily — break off small, insignificant sections of Alpha Complex from Computer control. Now, the Computer could reassert Itself anytime It wanted to, but It probably sees these traitorous areas as good places to test Its Armed Forces and Troubleshooter units. It might assign you to infiltrate or attack one ofthese simplexes and bring the Computer back to the Unhygienic Masses.
You could end up going to places like The Dungeon," "Diz-NEE's World," or "Bar's Ave" in search oftrouble to shoot. You could don infrared garb and creep into the "Nightcycle," where it is said clones feed on each other (yeck! PLC isn't that bad), or "The UnderGround," where mutants run rampant, blowing things up and flexing themselves in bright-colored spandex.
ASUSA/TURDS OUTDOORS
These are the scariest adventures of all. I, fortunately, have never been assigned a mission Outdoors — not that I would hesitate if the Computer ever ordered me — but I have read the reports.
They say Outdoors is big — bigger even than Alpha Complex itself (I find that hard to believe). They also say the ceiling is so high up that it is obscured by a bright blue that hurts the eyes. There is only one lamp there, and it doesn't always work — I suppose it was designed to simulate daycycle and nightcycle changes in Alpha Complex.
Whatever. Outdoors is scary because there are lots of nasty, unhygienic, dangerous things out there, and I don't want any part ofthem. Brr.
7ke Tbot/BtfSHOoreR Ttw
Everyone on the team is there for a reason. Some clones are assigned because of their skills, others because of their experience. Most often, it seems, Troubleshooters are assigned to particular teams because their number came up next.
Anyway, the Computer knows what's best, so I'm sure you're on whatever team you should be on. You'll fulfill a role to the best of your ability ... or else.
Шм UADTR
The Team Leader is the clone who gets to give the orders. Most often, he or she is the clone with the highest security clearance—though not always. The clone is automatically considered "in charge," and not obeying this Troubleshooter is treason — the Computer usually appoints the Team Leader, so the Team Leader speaks for the Computer when the Computer isn't available.
EQUfPMiNT Guy
This clone is in charge ofkeeping the team's equipment running and intact. When the Equipment Guy wants to look over that plasma gun you're carrying, you better give it to her, unless the Computer or the Team Leader says not to. The Equipment Guy is sometimes chosen because of her mechanical aptitude, but sometimes the Computer likes to give an inexperienced clone a challenge.
Нушеме OfffceR
The important role ofHygiene Officer is fulfilled by any clone the Computer thinks can keep the team spotless and clean for the mission. Being clean is good — a clean clone is a happy and healthy clone, while a dirty clone is a smelly and disgusting clone and not good for anyone's morale. The Hygiene Officer monitor's everyone's filth level and can even override the Team Leader's orders when he feels it is time to take a bath.
С0УАС7У OfffdR
Just as good clones must keep physically clean, they must also keep clean oftreason. The Loyalty Officer is in charge ofkeeping track ofwho does what to whom with what and when. The Loyalty Officer will be debriefed most carefully after the mission is over, and the Computer will use her observations when determining who performed the mission loyally and who will be seeing the inside of a food vat Real Soon. 
MORALE OFF/CER
Every successful team has to have a Morale Officer. If Troubleshooters aren't happy, they could fail in their missions, and we wouldn't want that, would we? The Morale Officer must keep the team cheerful in the face of adversity. While the Morale Officer cannot order the team to do things that countermand the Team Leader's orders or the mission parameters, he can order "extracurricular activities" designed to keep the team cheerful, Going into battle singing a Troubleshooter marching song is a good idea, or telling jokes while sneaking through the Outside is another. Blasting or disobeying the Morale Officer is nearly as bad as disobeying the Team Leader.
Oh, yes ... the Morale Officer is often assigned a whole assortment of "happy pills" and other pharmecuticals that make his job much easier.
COMMUMtCAT/OMS OFFfCFR
This clone is in charge of keeping the team members in contact with each other and, whenever possible, in contact with the Computer. Usually, the Comm Officer is assigned a vidtape recorder and a microphone, so she can do on-the-spot interviews with the Team Leader or the Morale Officer during a fire-fight, or catch the other team members in humorously embarrassing situations (like when Mac-I-NIF was carving up that Violet- clearance clone? That was a hoot).
OTHER Posmons TOR LACK THEREOF)
Ifyour Troubleshooter team is larger than six members, don't worry — the Computer will assign auxiliary positions. Perhaps the Loyalty Officer needs an assistant, or the Morale Officer's duty can be divided into Pharmecutical Dispenser and Joke Guy.
On the other hand, ifyou have fewer than six clones on your team, the positions might be divided up — the Team Leader could also be the Hygiene Officer, and the Communi¬cations Officer could double as the Loyalty Officer. The Computer might even decide that your team is, say, exceptionally well-groomed and doesn't need a Hygiene Officer.
TkEASOM AMD THE ПАМ
For some reason, when Troubleshooters look for trouble, they often find it... in their own ranks. I suppose this is because the Computer, in Its infinite storage capacity, knowingly assigned treasonous clones where It knew there would be Troubleshooters to look out for them. So feel free to unmask that Commie sympathizer in your party, or blast the Team Leader when he displays his unregistered mutant power. Hey, it is quite possible that you are the only loyal clone on the team!
DEATH, DYMG,AHO	COM/HG BACH
"Live free, play hard, die with your jumpsuit on. "
Well, maybe not — but let's face it, you're in a dangerous profession. Troubleshooter work is not for the faint of heart (sit down; you can't leave). You were selected because the Computer has faith in your ability to stand up for Alpha Complex and die like a clone when necessary.
But you know all about "six-packs," right? Clone #1 buys the simplex and you move on to Clone #2 with little to no interruption, right? Do you think it's that simple?
It is.
The Computer will send out a replacement, complete with MemoMax transfer that is exactly identical to its previous clone brother in all but one way — it isn't dead. All the skills, all the memories (including the memory of being killed), all the everything. Of course, sometimes the transfer can take a little time. The Clone Preparation and Revivification tubes (CPR) can sometimes get backed up (especially when a whole sector gets the finger all at once), or the Computer might want to do a little "remodeling" on your replacement. It might be a few seconds, a few minutes, or up to an hour before you get your new clone. Sit tight, and you'll arrive in due time.
9EATH AMD BOREDOM
Dying should never be boring. Oh, certainly, you might get blasted between the eyes by a RoboShlock Legal Enforement Sentry (ReS-LES), and that won't give you much time 
RED CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY RED-CLEARANCE CITIZENS
to react, but, in most cases, you should try to go out with a bang. Or a crash. Or even a whimper, if it is done in an interesting manner.
Why bother? Well, I've heard reports that clones that die horribly but with style have often received brevet promotions, extra equipment, orjust the Computer's favored wink- and-nod ("Attaboy, Dead-G-UIY!") and this is never anything to be sneezed at. Why the Computer should care how a Troubleshooter or traitor dies is beyond me, but It seems to.
А Сшл/ SCATS
Oh, and when you are forced to execute one of your team members for treason ... or when you get blasted for displaying an undisclosed mutant power ... or when the entire party dies in a horrible gun battle two minutes into the mission — remember, death means a fresh start. No paybacks.
At least not directly.
What this means is, ifI, Roy-G-BFV-3 were to get shot by you for oh, say, using a mutant power I never reported to the Computer and then the Computer dumps Roy-G-BFV-4 in
front of you, you don’t just blast him.
"But if you had a mutant power and he's identical to you, don't you have the same mutant power?"
Not necessarily, Buck-O. See, the Computer believes that mutant powers, Secret Society membership, and general treasonous activity are clone-specific, not part of Its clone templates. So, when you get a replacement clone, the Computer thinks It has "corrected" whatever problem existed in your previous life. So no blasting.
That goes the other way as well. If you end up executing me for treason, my clone replacement would not be playing by the Computer's rules if he shows up and starts blasting all ofyou without any more reason than his clone brother's execution. He may know you did it, and he may remember it, and he may even resent it and want to get back at you, but he has to do it the Paranoia way — when he can prove you deserve it (at least after-the-fact).
STR/XE #C, YOU'RE OUT
You are not a free man, you are a clone, and ifyour clone number is #6, you are probably more than a little nervous. You're at the end of your six-pack, and you won't be coming back if you get fried.
The Computer, however, takes a dim view of Troubleshooters who off #6's without a really good excuse. Where the Computer will usually accept arguments like "He was a traitor!" for a clone #1 or #2 whacking, when you start into the second halfthe Computer starts to get suspicious. It created all these clones — It couldn't have made that many mistakes, could It?
The Computer never makes mistakes.
If you kill a clone #6, either make it look like an accident or have an ironclad reason.
Ifyou lose clone #6, it's time to generate a new character and continue onwards. The gamemaster has a few recommendations that can make your second and subsequent Paranoia characters fit into the existing team relatively well — ifhe wants to use them.
REWARDS FOR torn SERP/CE
All right, you've heard your responsibilities and you know what will happen to you if you fail — here are some of the "bennies" that go with the "slaps."
EXTRA 7AAWA/G
When Troubleshooters perform well in the face of adversity, the Computer will often allow them extra training in-between missions. They can either learn or improve skills through practice, or they can receive MemoMax implants — the method is up to the Computer. The result is the same.
The Computer chooses to reward a diligent clone for extremely loyal service with a new skill or improvement on an old one. The clone reports — in-between missions — to a training center or MemoMax implant office. The clone undergoes the training or implant, and either learns or fails to learn a new skill or improve an old one.
Strangely enough, the chances that a clone will learn a Computer-trained skill are exactly the same as ifhe or she was training independently. Roll 1d20 and, if the roll is 
Paranoiai The Fifth Edition i;1i,i/eni,i'«ei;iit,i,nnitnii!»*•	!/■««■,«'i
RED CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY RED-CLEARANCE CITIZENS 

 
equal to or higher than the clone's current skill value, the clone improves the skill by one rank. If the roll is lower, the clone fails to learn anything new.
The roll of one, however, has a new, more deadly meaning. Instead of losing ground in a particular skill's development, the clone had an accident during training. The hapless Troubleshooter got in the way of a malfunctioning training device, or a MemoMax injection went into his pulmonary artery instead of his carotid, or what have you. The clone dies. Activate the next clone, or generate the next character. Sorry.
When this happens, the Computer will react in one of two ways: Either It will apologize for the obviously Commie-inspired error and give the replacement clone another bennie to replace this one, or It will blame the clone for "messing up" and wasting valuable Computer property, time, and resources. The clone will then receive some sort of "slap" for his/her misbehavior.
VOUCHERS & fosm
A good bureaucracy moves on its paperwork, and Alpha Complex is a mighty bureaucracy. Equipment Forms, Termination Vouchers, Debriefing Forms, and a multi¬tude of other documents that Thou Shalt Not Fold, Bend, Spindle, or Mutilate are the blood that flows through Alpha's bureaucracy's veins.
Most often, Troubleshooters will be asked to fill out reams of forms before going on missions, before taking particular actions, or even before filling out other forms. They will seldom have a choice regarding what forms they fill out or what vouchers they have access to.
But, as a bennie, the Computer might give them an authorized form that they can fill out to their satisfaction—when the need arises. For example, Troubleshooters often have difficulty executing obvious traitors when those traitors are protected by other, more heavily-armed clones, bots, and/or security devices. Nothing is more frustrating than seeing a traitor thumb his nose at you through six inches of transparent, blast-shielded 
RED CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY RED-CLEARANCE CITIZENS
synthesteel. But, if the Troubleshooter team had an authorized Termination Voucher, they could bull their way past all loyal Citizens and security devices, execute the traitor, and whistle off to their next mission.
Of course, all of these forms will be limited in their application. For example, an Equipment Voucher might have the Computer's authorization seal on it — stating that the Computer says it is "okay" for the Troubleshooter to have certain equipment — but the actual equipment the Troubleshooter has to choose from might be very limited ("no weapons," "no vehicles," "no armor," etc.). And, naturally, nothing above the clone's security clearance would be granted, unless the Computer also assigned the Trouble-shooter a brevet promotion.
WHAT'S A BASEST РАОМОТЮМ?
Glad you asked.
Sometimes, the Computer assigns a Troubleshooter a brevet promotion so that the clone can use equipment higher than his security clearance, or go to places in Alpha Complex that are restricted to upper-clearance citizens, or retain knowledge that the clone would otherwise be executed for. Of course (getting sick of hearing that, aren't you?), the Computer often limits the scope of the brevet promotion.
The most common brevet promotion is the one or two security clearance "all-purpose" brevet. This brevet makes the clone temporarily one or two security clearance levels higher. The brevet is seldom permanent (otherwise it wouldn't be a brevet), but the clone has all privileges and rank ofthe higher clearance brevet. So, ifKoom-B-YAH were given a one-level all-purpose brevet for, say, the length of a mission, he would be Koom-I-YAH until the mission ended.
Less common but often more fun brevets are the "special service" brevets. The Troubleshooter has been breveted for a special reason, and receives special privileges, but they are more limited.
For example, a character who is assigned a piece ofspecial R&D equipment might not be of high enough clearance to carry it, use it, or even see it used. If the Computer is in a particularly generous mood, It might give the clone an "equipment brevet" for that piece of equipment or all equipment in general. "Visitor brevets" (brevets that allow the clone to go to higher security clearance areas) are also good examples ofspecial service brevets.
Note: The Computer is under no obligation to assign any sort of brevets for any mission —that is why brevets are under "bennies" and not some section like "entitlements." Ifthe Computer did not give you a brevet and you feel you need one, it's probably your fault.
PIAST/CREDS MAKE THE COMPLEX GO 'Room
I suppose you know that clones do not really have "personal property" — everything belongs to the Complex and is distributed by the Computer. That's true, but Troubleshoot¬ers do accumulate stuff that the Computer doesn't, apparently, want back. Stuff is a bennie, but plasticreds are an even bigger bennie.
Plasticreds are the money of Alpha Complex. We accumulate them by doing extra special jobs for the Computer and for higher clearance clones, and by trading our "personal" stuff for them. Plasticreds are small, plastic coins encoded with a particular value — any value is possible, but ones, tens, fifties and hundreds are the most likely.
You can use plasticreds to buy personal stuff or to bribe other clones for "favors." The plasticred, however, only has as much value as the Computer or the clone you are offering it to decides. Generally, lower clearance clones think ofplasticreds as incredibly valuable — they have so few privileges that the ability to "buy" things is terrific — while higher clearance clones can simply order lower clearance clones to give or get them things or services they might desire.
Plasticreds can seldom be used to buy things like weapons, armor, or really nifty equipment. They might, however, influence the clones in charge ofthe proper requisition
forms.
Ewes
Sometimes, the Computer will impose fines on Troubleshooters for unjustified or unexplained damage to Computer property, or for borderline treasonous activity. A clone might be fined 100 plasticreds for showing up a minute late at a briefing (he might be executed as well, but it's up to the Computer). If the clone has enough plasticreds to pay 


 


















 

 
the fine, then nothing extremely nasty should happen to him. Fines are very arbitrary and are seldom used to punish real treason (see "The Price of Treason," below ).
P£RMAM£A/T PROMOT/OA/
While promotions are seldom "permanent," when a clone is promoted from one clearance to another in any way other than the awarding of a brevet, the promotion is considered permanent - - until the Computer decides to promote, execute, or demote the clone again.
Troubleshooters are often awarded security clearance promotions at the end of missions that were particularly successful or entertaining. Sometimes, the promotion allows the clone to move on to a new line of duly, other times, the Troubleshooter just becomes a more important clone within the Trouble-shooters. This is probably the best bennie a clone can receive.

You can get executed for nut pleasing the Computer. Most clones think that's the worst thing that can happen to you. Believe me, it isn't.
The Computer has a whole system of ''slaps" it uses to motivate chines into more acceptable styles ofbehavior. Even the most loyal clone can sometimes slip up and incur a slap. Some slaps are simply that - a "slap on the wrist" used to remind the Troubleshooter ofwlrs boss. Other times, a slap might be more like,a right cross from a warbot's ganntleted list. Oh, that hurts.
Тке Ршо£ of /х£#±-ол/
One of the most common slaps for low clearance clones who commit minor ofienses against the Computer are fines. These fines are levied against clones who. usually, don't 
RED CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY RED-CLEARANCE CITIZENS
know any better and just made a little mistake. They could amount to any number of plasticreds — literally. I remember hearing about a clone who dropped FunTime Algae Chip crumbs on a briefing room carpet and was ordered to pay a fine of P$5 for his error. Another clone came in, days later, and did the same thing and he was fined P$5000 and reprimanded for repeating the offense—even though he wasn't the one who did it the first time.
Rest assured, though, all Computer-imposed fines are completely fair.
Any serious treason cannot be paid off with fines (usually), and higher security clearance clones are seldom given this slap unless the Computer really thinks it is important (they are supposed to "know better").
Оемот/ол/
One ofthe most humiliating slaps is demotion. Y ou worked hard to get where you are, and then, because somebody else did something stupid and you got blamed (it's always somebody else, isn't it?) you get demoted one or more security clearances. That sucks vat slime.
What's even worse is those clones you used to boss around are now your peers — or your betters. You'll have to put up with theirjeers and taunts and all the indignities they force on you (when you forced that clone to clean out the warbot's cannon during a rapid fire test, it was necessary — he's just doing it to you to be mean).
TARASOV POfMTS
Contrary to popular belief, the Computer does not always execute, or order the execution, of traitors immediately. Sometimes, It gives them a chance to recant their treason and do better. But It remembers what they've done and It keeps track oftheir treason.
Every clone starts with zero treason points (unless the Computer says otherwise). When the Computer observes the clone performing a treasonous or questionable act — or when an informer reports the same — the Computer may choose to assign the clone a certain number oftreason points that It feels the treason is "worth." When the clone gets a certain number of treason points, the Computer executes the traitor.
How many treason points can you receive for what treasonous activities? How many treason points can you get before you are executed? I'm sorry, that information is above your security clearance, Citizen.
REDOC/NG TREASON PO/NTS
The only way to reduce treason points (and stay alive) is to be an extra-loyal, extra¬enthusiastic servant ofthe Computer. Sing loyalty songs, even when the Morale Officer isn't asking for them; volunteer for hazardous duty; turn in other Troubleshooters as traitors (and make it stick). Basically, bootlick and brown-nose your way out of trouble.
Oh, ifyou manage to get yourselfkilled while you have treason points, that pretty much wipes the slate clean as well.

A common mistake made by ambitious young Troubleshooters is acting heroically in the service of the Computer. The proper approach is to direct subordinates to act heroically; then, after their inevitable and carefully-planned demise (often in the act of heroism), claim credit for their heroic deeds.
Always present orders that entail certain death for subordinates in such a way as to suggest that you are graciously offering them an opportunity to distinguish themselves.
"Here, Gone-R, you take this experimental plasma-powered flashlight. I'm sure a comprehensive report on its testing will earn you a commendation.”
”Splat-R, I commend you on your courage in volunteering to disarm the berserk scrubot. None of us veterans coud begrudge you the honor of serving the Computer in so selfless and loyal a fashion.”
Beware of excessively-cooperative bootlickers. Many are simply mindlessly loyal and courageous, and present no threat to you, and you will find it easy to assign them useful tasks they will not survive. However, a shrewd bootlicker may scheme a way to survive the task you assign, planning to exploit his actions to further his ambitions, or to plotyour demise. Assign him the task he has volunteered for, but add some additional complication that he cannot have anticipated. For example:
"Why, thank you for volunteering to attempt salvage of that malfunctioning plasma cannon. A noble gesture. Of course, with such a dangerous mission, it would be unwise for you to further risk any of the Computer's valuable equipment by exposing it to any explosion that might result if you should fail. Therefore I regret that you will have to leave all your equipment here with us in the bunker. Yes, I'm afraid that means your tool kit also.”

Whenever possible, reduce the number of Troubleshooters in your mission group. Several basic principles are at work here:
•	Fewer Troubleshooters means fewer weapons aimed at your back.
•	Fewer Troubleshooters means more casualties to be tailored to your scapegoat requirements without the embarrassment of contradictory testimony. 
CLEARANCE. . .APPROVEDFORUSEBYRED-CLEARANCECI
"Yes, the villainous traitor Fawlg-I was obviously responsible for sabotaging our mission at every turn. How unfortunate that he did not survive so that we might force from him the complete story of his heinous betrayals."
• Fewer Troubleshooters means less confusion when commendations are handed out. If you are the only survivor ofa successfu I mission, you can certainly dramatize your crucial role without fear of contradiction.
The unsophisticated method of reducing mission staff is summary execution. This technique is effective ifwell-planned and carried out, but ifno more than an impulsive bit of gunplay, the executioner is often executed by his victim or by other trigger-happy citizens who want to join in the fun.
The "accident" is a more controlled and efficient method of reducing staff. First, a properly-staged accident, even if it fails, does not necessarily prompt the victim to pull his weapon and start firing. A well-planned accident may not even alert a victim that he has been the target of an attack, and even if he suspects that he has been set up, the victim is not sure who to shoot in retailiation. Also, occasionally survivors may be called to task when a mission group is decimated; if the fatalities were obviously "accidents," charges of false execution are not likely to be filed.

A good position in the marching order is vital to survival. Since the mission loader usually has the power to order the group to deploy as he likes, a discussion of best choices is properly addressed to him. However, if a mission leader is weak or stupid enough to permit personnel to position themselves as they will, other Troubleshooters should understand these basic principles:
The coveted position in any mission deployment is in the rear of the group. Normally this position is preempted by the mission leader. (0, fortunate mission leader). Ifyou are the mission leader, or the ranking citizen, demand this privilege. Do not be swayed by clever tactics like:
"Say, my combat skills and training make me the perfect one to guard against attack from the rear."
Or:
"Since 1 carry the multicorder and must record all our activities, I must stand behind you, Mission Leader, Sir, for a panoramic view."
Of course, if you are not the mission leader, you must try these clever tactics. Some inexperienced or dim-witted mission leaders may fall for them. However, if the mission leader assumes the rear, then you must scramble to assure yourself the best spot you can wrangle. Far right or left flank is usually the second best choice for a combatant, affording a wide field of vision and fire.
That's right I've learned Next	Ifyou are the multicorder operator or some other technician, you can usually make a

and I point my laser at him.	leader arranges to eliminate any recordings of the mission, and that the multicorder
a v a a a a a	operator is at serious risk when near the mission leader and out of lino of sight ofthe rest
of the group.
The rear position is coveted not only for its, superior range of lire and the safety it affords from backs tabbing, it also is the place where fewest eyes are trained; for those who wish to do things they do not want noticed, this is the ideal position.
Conversely, not only is the point man the focus of all weapons in his own party, as well as the weapons of any opponents, he is also constantly subjected to the scrutiny of his companions. This position should be assigned by the mission leader to the Troubleshooter most likely to present a real threat to him. Never waste this resource by placing a low- status nincompoop there.
Wimps and morons should be graciously assigned a position in the center-rear of the group, and told: "Now, aren't 1 a kind and considerate mission leader to place you inexperienced men in such a sale spot?" Reassure them often about how sale they are, then 

















 

 
terminate them at your leisure after the tough guys have been eliminated.

Dot/T START ANYTH we you CAN'T fw/sn — PRSTTRABIY, TO COMPONENT ATOMS
Inexperienced Troubleshooters haul out their-lasers and open fire the moment someone says or does something that might be construed as treason. This is dumb. You are not looking for an excuse to execute someone. You are looking for an opportunity to execute someone in such a thorough and risk-free fashion that he is dead before his weapon can clear his holster.
Given the generally poor marksmanship of Troubleshooters, the unreliable killing power of their weapons, and the substantial protection of armor, the chances of nailing a prospective traitor before he gets off several shots is exceedingly small; thus, you are as likely to die as your victim. Dumb.
Bide your time, build your case, then plug him when he is relatively unable to return your fire. An ideal time is when he has his hands full of some other kind of trouble, like attacking hostiles or a malfunctioning weapon or a berserk bot. At the very least, his weapon should still be in its holster and his attention engaged elsewhere. Ideally, he should never even know you attacked him. Whenever possible, attack when you have superior firepower, or when circumstances ensure that you will hit your target — for instance, when you are standing behind him with your slugthrower pointed at his head.
Often resorting to weapons at all is unwise. Normally the "accident" is a more effective way of eliminating a traitor and claiming a commendation, and ifyou never get a good opportunity during the mission, there's always the debriefing. A well-supported case of 
Paranoiaт The Fifth Edition i;1',n,li*il«,ii<,i;nl,l',ii'iie«iii:»ei;l,,n,iSu1,»'*
CLEARANCE. . .APPROVEDFORUSEBYRED-CLEARANCE CI
treason is a more deadly weapon than a laser and less likely to backfire on you than a summary execution.
A SUCKER FOR EVERY SCHEME, AND A SCAPEGOAT FOR EVERY CRIME
Carefully select your prime victims. Certain types make excellent suckers and scapegoats. Trigger-happy, impulsive types can easily be induced to start trouble with hostiles, facilitating your shooting them from behind. Super-loyal, heroic types can usually be talked into getting involved in risky ventures that will either kill them or distract them enough to give you a good shot at them. Naive eager types who throw themselves whole-heartedly into a mission won't have time to notice the sneaky stuff you're doing to them.
Scapegoats should be of lower clearance than you, so you can give them orders which set them up as fall guys when your schemes backfire or blow up in your face. For example, just before you test an experimental weapon, always ask a lower-status tech to inspect it first. If something goes wrong, obviously the tech damaged it during his inspection. (Of course, keep an eye on the tech at all times to make sure he isn't really sabotaging the weapon.)
Absent scapegoats (either deceased, missing, or imaginary) are preferable to scape¬goats who can stand up at the debriefing and defend themselves. The all-time favorite scapegoat is the hypothetical Commie-mutant-traitor lurking just out of sight. The Computer is an easy mark for the impassioned, melodramatic speech which conjures sinister images: evil agents hidden under benign, loyal smiles; demonic criminals hovering behind every back; tiny, gremlin-like presences of unimaginable malevolence and almost magical power to avoid detection. As long as other citizens can be dissuaded from persistently pointing their lingers at you and crying, "Traitor!" The Computer can be easily sent offon some wild hot chase, searching for an imaginary Commie, while your treasonous acts are overlooked in the hysteria.
TRAITORS HAVE MOTH/NG TO LOSE BY COMMITTING TREASON
Many traitors are too indoctrinated by the Computer's propaganda to profit from their treason, despite the fact that they are as likely to be executed for treason whether they behave treasonously or not.
Mutants, for example. How many mutants effectively exploit their innate capabilities? Sure, many mutant powers are pretty unimpressive, but a power like hypersenses is just perfect for gathering information.
The best power is telekinesis. Think ofthe possibilities for planting false evidence, or pulling the pin on grenades, or squeezing the trigger on another Troubleshooter's weapon in the middle of a briefing or R&D visit. Rumor has it that there is a secret society that can teach people how to use these powers. Sign up in a hurry ifyou make contact with them.
And, speaking ofsecret societies, no one ever uses secret society connections to full measure. Sure, it's dangerous, but what isn't in Alpha Complex? The moment I get a new mission, I find some excuse to stop by my secret society drop points and get the inside scoop from some highly placed lodge brother, or wrangle a special secret society assignment that promises a big payoff in Infrared market information or equipment.
"Err, excuse me, Mission Leader, but it appears that my laser barrel has only one shot left, and my spare has a hairline fracture at the aperture [carefully put there forjust such an emergency]. Let me drop by PLC supply and pick up a couple of new ones so I'll be primed for this important mission."
And don't be shy when asking for information or equipment. You aren't going to get something unless somebody is feeling generous, anyway. Secret society higher-ups prefer a little unbridled greed in subordinates; it displays promise, ambition, and enthusiasm that may be channeled into bootlicking profitable for all parties concerned.

"/ speak without fear of contradiction..." is the opening sentence of the ideal debriefing. A creative dramatist can transform a disastrous mission replete with treasonous crimes into a glowing heroic narrative with the speaker as the modest model of a loyal, courageous citizen serving the Computer with all his heart.
First, other Troubleshooters are potentially embarrassing records ofthe mission. Get rid of them. Since wholesale slaughter is not always practical, bribing or blackmailing them into supporting your story may be an alternative.
Recording devices, like bots, multicorders, and live radio/vidcom links with the party must be eliminated, sabotaged, or distracted whenever possible. Such records are evidence that is hard to explain away, and more difficult to dismiss as Commie treason than the verbal statements of other Troubleshooters. Be prudent, however. Unsubtle and unrestrained destruction of recording and transmitting devices will be interpreted as a deliberate effort to compromise the records. It may be sufficient to make sure that the multicorder is turned the other way or that the snooperbot is busy down the hall while you perpetrate nefarious deeds.
If you volunteer or are chosen as the multicorder operator, your problems are more complicated. First, you wish to survive, which is not consistent with carrying something that others are eager to destroy. Further, you are the one who gets the fines ifthe device is damaged or destroyed. To impove your chances of survival, stick close to the mission leader—usually in the rear ofthe party and thus less subject to outright attacks. Further, make it known that for a few credits you can make sure that the mission record features a Troubleshooter's finest moments and overlooks his outright treasonous acts.
Another clever ploy is providing narration for the record tapes by speaking loudly as the events are recorded.
"Note the diligent labor of Citizen Bumm-R as he searches for the source of the jackobot’s malfunction." (Bumm-R is in fact reprogramming the bot to respond to a remote control self-destruct device that will obviate the need for an extensive debriefing by obliterating the other party members and the briefing personnel.)

When called upon to perform the impossible in the face of certain death, we always politely ask the Computer ifwe can go to the bathroom first — and ifwe can have a glass ofwater — and ifwe can check just one more reference by data search — and ifwe can fieldstrip the electron howitzer to find that buzzing noise it makes when you set the fuse timer—and so on — and so forth. This tactic is most effective ifthe requests can be made privately and without alerting the rest ofthe mission group to the fact that you will be tarrying behind just a little bit. Once they catch on, everyone gets into the act, and the Computer's temper-simulation software gets short.
Stalling is also the ideal tactic for resisting the peremptory orders of superiors. "Of course, sir, right away, I'm right on top of it, just have to get my tools ready, yessir, err, could you stand back a bit so I can spread these out on the floor and make sure all ofthem are neatly sorted by size, shape, color, and serial number?"
Of course, stalling doesn't make the looming disaster go away. While you're stalling, you must continue feverishly brainstorming and scheming, hoping for some inspiration or the intervention of good fortune. A gifted footdragger has one special resource he can
ways count on — the impatience of other Troubleshooters. If the stalling is executed withexquisite subtlety—ifyourmissionleaderandfellow Troubleshooters perceiveyour actions as bumbling incompetence, finicky perfectionism, tiresome attention to detail, or simple cowardice — if they don't perceive your actions at all, so perfectly have you managed to avoid attracting their attention — then the action-oriented, impulsive types w? often push forward, elbow you out ofthe way, and stride confidently into the trap you were desperately hoping to avoid.

Other team members can be persuaded to help you out if they think there is something in it for them. Ifthey are relatively friendly (i.e., they are not obviously trying to obliterate you), they are probably inexperienced and can be taken advantage of. Do so by making yourself their best buddy or even their hero. Pass up an obvious advantage over a Troubleshooter you could have eliminated and make it clear that you're really "on his side."
"Here, Citizen Suck-R, grab onto this cable and I’ll pull you up. No, don’t worry; I won’t drop you into that vat of acid, even though you were the one who ratted on me about those extra pieces of equipment I ...appropriated from PLC. Upsy-daisy!"
A smart Troubleshooter would probably see through this "make friends" scheme, but many will feel a lingering indebtedness to you — which might make them hesitate at the right moment. Basically, just try to weigh the immediate gain of eliminating an enemy against possible future benefits.
If the clone is an obvious enemy — he has tried to implicate you in obvious treasonous
activities or has fired shots in your direction on more than one occasion — you walk a thin line. Probably, this guy is going to need a laser hole in the back of the head before he becomes more cooperative. However, you can win him over ifyou can turn the tables on him. Use any resources you have handy — secret society contacts, multicorders, etc. — to ensure he is in a bad position (and one that won't go away just because he eliminates your current clone).
Then blackmail him.
"Okay, Citizen Harr-I-SON, you got me dead to rights. Too bad that when my clone number racks up, they’ll find all that multicorder evidence of you smuggling SpicyStuff MunehySnaks through your Free Enterpriee contacts. How do I know? Let’s just say a little bot told me ..."
The joy of blackmail is that the clone is never quite sure you really have the goods on him, or that he can't just wipe you out and be done with it. This sets the experienced extortionist apart from the guy with the cone rifle stuck up his nose — instead of blackmailing your victim until he thinks he's got nothing left to lose, enter into a "partnership." Make sure he gets good things out of the deal as well:

So you blackmail Harr-I-SON into backing up your story and making you the hero. But, ifyou give him the "loyal sidekick" role, he'll get a few bennies from the Computer as well ... and maybe he'll start acting like it.

A Ume SUGAR Goes A LONG WAY
Pass along equipment, plasticreds, and information you can spare to those in need. In this case, your party members are secondary on the consideration list — they're likely to take it for granted that you're "helping the group," rather than wisely interpreting the gift for what it is: a bribe.
Don't ask for anything right away. Just make sure that Vulture Trooper likes his new Teela O'Malley pendant, or that briefing officer got the right flavor of Bouncy Bubble Beverage. Keep it up, and they might remember later. It's an investment in your future.
The same thing can work on the Computer, though it's a little trickier. The Computer has no need for plasticreds and It owns all the equipment in Alpha Complex, so you'll find it hard to bribe the Computer with material things. However, you can volunteer information that the Computer might think valuable, even when you lose something in the process:
"Friend Computer! I hate to interrupt our very necessary trip through PLC for such an unimportant detail, but it seems that my Equipment Requisition

You'll get glares from the rest ofyour party, and the Computer Itself will probably be surprised at your honesty, but you can win some bennie points here for honesty — a rare and refreshing trait in Alpha Complex — that might pay off later.
PARTNERS ARE BETTER И/HEM KEPT AT A O/STAVCE
While it is a good thing to partner-up with a team member and develop a certain amount of trust, it is a better thing to have one or two buddies outside of the team who owe you a favor or two. For one thing, they are less likely to be able to betray you in a moment of opportunism, and for another, they can take over where you left off ifyou are unable to continue.
Pass along equipment and information on your current mission to someone you can semi-trust (i.e., they won't be able to use it against you). Maybe that cone rifle you "found" would be really nice on this mission, but it would also prompt a few unanswerable questions. Make contact with your friend and pass it along. If you need it, you might be able to get it back later (probably not). If you get eliminated, maybe he can use it on whoever was responsible.
This is not a completely reliable means of insuring your own survival, but it might insure that some ofyour interests survive. After all, is it more important that you don't bust your six-pack, or that everyone who screwed you gets theirs?

Finally, if you are hanging around with a tough crowd — everybody knows how to survive in Alpha Complex and nobody's succumbing to bribes or blackmail — make the best of it. Become the occasional dupe or clown. Be the patsy everyone wants to keep around to take the blame. When you do lose a clone (which will probably happen fairly often at first, less often when the others catch on), go down smiling and come back even dumber and funnier than before.
Is this giving in or giving up? No—the Computer appreciates a good-natured clone and will, eventually, see through even the most elaborate frame-up. Ifyou really play your cards right, you'll get skyrocketed to success on a Computer whim ... then we'll see who's laughing.
"Citizen Scape-G-OAT, it seems that, yet again, you have performed heinous treason against Alpha Complex and Me, the Computer. Your Troubleshooter teammates have all implicated you in a scheme to overcharge the reactor core and melt down it and everyone in RAD sector, and they have tied you to another scheme involving yourself, a bagful of Anti-Hormone-Inhibitor pills, and a textile-covered creature brought in from the Outdoors. How do you plead?"
"Friend Computer. I would be the last clone in the Complex to refute my loyal team’s statements and, even though I am on my last clone and know that this is the end of my career and life as a Troubleshooter, I would like to make a full confession. I swear by my love of Alpha Complex, the Computer, and Teela O’Malley, that whatever heinous things my fellow Troubleshooters say I did, I must have done. In addition, I would like to say that all the information that Citizen Gome-R-PIL has been compiling on my secret society connections that he has not yet turned in is true, and all those multicorder tapes of me commit¬ting treason that Citizen Con-I-CHG has hidden in her creche but has not reported to You are authentic, and all..."
You may get off scot-free as the Computer feels your treasonous activity is much less heinous than your compatriots' (it is treason not to report treason), you may get promoted, or you may get executed.
But, if the latter, you won't bo alone ...

Oh, yes. That's right. Paranoia gamemasters have to have Ultraviolet clearance, Do you have Ultraviolet clearance, Citizen? Ifnot, please execute yourselfnow. Ifyou do, then sorry about the wait, Oh-High-Programmer-Sir, it won't happen again.
Ike Joy Of Putvneoe
As a Paranoia gamemaster, you are the master of all you survey. The players are mere dust-specks in the universe that you create and rule with an iron fist. "Fair play" and "even-handed consistency" are phrases you hold in disdain, You can do anything you want to the players' characters, put them through any torture imaginable, subject them to any indignity, and there's nothing they can do about it.
Except stop playing.
Tke RfAury of вттлзтешв
The players should be ready to accept the fact that you arc going to do your best to make their characters' lives about as pleasant as the smell that emanates from a food vat that's been emptied, but not cleaned, and left, out in the open air under hot lights for about ten daycycles. That's one ofthe joys ofParanoia — the players are under no pressure to have their characters ''achieve levels" or "become more powerful." They already know that, no matter what they do, the Computer, enemy Secret Societies, the Commies, the Mutants, or the Traitors will end up destroying them in the end. All they have to worry about is roleplaying this crazy world to the hilt and enjoying themselves.
But that's the key, isn't it? How can you abuse the players' characters and still make the game fun?
tr АшУ AS HARO MS /r ±JOA/US
Relax. Again, most ofyour players, if they read the players' section of this book, will have some idea ofwhat to expect. There are several keys to fepng	things fun, however. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
SPREAD THE GREET AROUA/D
"Misery loves company" is a cliche. It's a cliche because it is true. If you pick on one player, over and over again, either that player will get annoyed at you, or everyone elsewill be annoyed because he's getting all the attention. If you do one or two nasty gags to somebody, start in on someone else next. Of course, there are going to be people who just ask for it... then you hit them with both barrels until they learn.
Know WHEAT TO PAA/DER
When your players begin to figure out things about Alpha Complex and Paranoia in general, they will probably react in one oftwo ways. The first way is to goofit up and enjoy it. That's easy to handle — keep inventing or stealing plots for adventures and let them run amok. They'll cycle through clones and Troubleshooters at any rate you see fit, and everyone will have a good old time.
On the other hand, there are players who will decide to "play it smart." They'll stop taking anything for granted, and they'll look on every action you take as critical to their
characters' future development.
This is what you want to avoid. Even though this edition ofParanoia encourages you to play Paranoia as a "campaignable" game, it really is supposed to work a lot differently than other, not-fun roleplaying games. "Smart play" belongs in other RPGs. Characters who check every lock for a trap, question everyone they meet at length about things there's no way they'd know anything about, and who won't stick their neck in a noose with a smile just don't belong in Paranoia.
There's really an easy cure for this. Turn the tables on 'em. Characters who sit back and let others take all the risks (and cause you all the amusement) will, at first, feel safe because characters who take risks in Paranoia get turned into vat-paste. However, when you see some players holding back too often, you should start having the risk-takers succeed at ludicrous actions, gain promotions, and lose less lives than those who are "playing it smart." Here are some examples that expand on some Paranoia, 2nd Edition examples of play.
The Anti-Tactician: The characters are pinned down by enemy fire behind a rapidly-
dissolving pile of cover. All the players are arguing over what to do, when one heroic soul declares:
Player: "Humph! Stand back, timorous cravens! My character leaps over the barricade into the hail of bullets, sowing grenades like seeds, charging resolutely toward the Commie traitors while chanting "The Computer is my buddy, I shall not want..."
Gamemaster: "Bravo! Bravissimo! Well ... (rolls thirty times or so for the Commie traitors’ automatic weapon attacks, sighs regretfully) they cut you to pieces ... (rolls dice again for grenades; brazenly ignores the results) but your grenades all miraculously find their marks, the Commie menace is eliminated, you are posthumously awarded the Silver Monitor with Crossed Circuitboards for Bravery, and you next clone receives a brevet promotion. A round of applause, please?"
That's great, but what if the players still don't get the hint? What if "Player" is the only one who ever does stufflike this, while the others sit back in safety, never causing you any amusement at all? How about substituting this paragraph for the Gamemaster's re¬sponse:
Gamemaster: "Bravo! Bravissimo! Well... you leap out of cover and lob your grenades at the enemy gun emplacements — and that's what they are: gun emplacements manned by reprogrammed scrubots! (Rolls dice, ignores result.) You make your perception check and notice that they are mindlessly firing at the cover you were hiding behind. (Rolls dice again, obviously ignores result.) Dextrously, you dodge out of the way, tossing grenades hither and yon. (Rolls dice yet again, wincing convincingly.) Oooh! Too bad — a critical failure. (Contemplates for a minute, rolls dice and seems to study them, then sighs.) Well, the grenades take out most of the scrubots, but a few bounce down into the cover your 'friends' are hiding behind. (Clatter of more dice.) Which explodes in a ball of fire. The remaining scrubots begin to fire at the craven cow — I mean, at the rest of the team unobstructed. (Clatter.) Ow! That's gotta hurt..."
And if they don't get the hint, pull out a situation like this:
The Reluctant Volunteers: The player characters are being asked to volunteer for special R&D equipment. This is where the gamemaster normally stick it to anyone stupid enough to volunteer to test R&D gizmos. The techs hold one piece of equipment that 
Paranoiai The Fifth Edition
nobody really recognizes in their hands, and refuse to explain what it does until someone volunteers.
Gamemaster (as head tech): "Veil, who vill volunteer to test diz veddy, veddy valuable peece ov Computer equipment?"
Players: (Everyone looks at their toes, the ceiling, or in other directions entirely)
Gamemaster: "C'mon, c'mon; ze Computer zayz zomeone muzt test it! Who vill id be?"
One Player: (sighing heavily) "All right. Suck-R steps up and volunteers as wholeheart¬edly as he can while trying not to cry. He passes a note to Cheep-O: it's his last will and testament. 'I hereby leave my Red clearance, yellow-coated, chemical-blend, squeaking water fowl and bathing apparatus to ..."
Gamemaster: "Let me help you put this on ... (Rollsdice. ) Oops-zec! Probably shouldn't have touched that button! I wonder vhat id does?" (Techs scatter in all directions as equipment starts humming and smoking.)
But is it Suck-R who always gets stuck with the R&D stuff? If it is, start throwing in this substitution:
There! Now, push that red button
Gamemaster (as himself): "The apparatus begins to hum. Loudly. The techs all step away, a few break for the door. Y ou start to think that maybe this was a bad idea when, suddenly, metal sheaths and prongs and hinges start to click into place with inhuman precision. A hel¬met comes over your head, and you can sud¬denly see much better than before. Armor cov¬ers you from head to toe, and weapons appear out ofthe suit's forearms and shoulders. A voice says in your ear. 'Mark VII-D Battlegear fully operational. Targeting, online; sequencing online; lasers, missiles, and grenade launcher online. Who shall we kill first, master?"
Player: (Turns toward his craven teammates with a glint in his eye . ..)
Of course, you don't want this to get too predictable, either. When the others start vol¬unteering or roleplaying well, give them the occasional bennie, but slap them down as well. Don't let them catch you in a pattern; Paranoia is supposed to be unpredictable and bizarre. If they know what's going to happen before it does, you've lost the spontaneity that makes the game great.
Ur ‘ем Do rue И/ORR FOR УОО
In your group, there will emerge at least one good player — maybe more. Maybe that person won't be "good" all the time, but it's quite likely he'll be "on" at least some of the time. Either that, or everyone will have occasional inspira¬tions and moments of glory.
Play this up. Really make a fuss over players that really act out their roles — especially when they do it to their own disadvantage. The char¬acter that walks up to the big wall and pushes the giant red button surrounded by "Danger! Danger!" signs because he is pretty sure his character would — and then gets flattened by an Emergency Gravitational Defense and Test¬ing Device (a sixteen-ton safe suspended from the ceiling) deserves to be congratulated.

something for their trouble ifyou want. Not always what they ask for ... but sometimes something useful.
ASS/GMWG Сашрмемт
As with everything else, Troubleshooters have no choice as to what e quipment they get, and PLC will often foist stuff off on them (with or without Computer approval) just to get it out of their warehouse. What's worse is that the Troubleshooters have to sign for everything, and they are responsible for returning or explaining the use of everyihing they take — whether they wanted it or not. I (ours of fun, thousands in fines.
3.	ACROSS TH€ CORR/DOR TO R&D
Research and Development is even more dangerous than PLC. See. the Computer has R&D work on new devices and gadgets for use by all aspects of Alpha Complex (Krunchy Kola Breakfast Drink was theirs), but the Troubleshooters are assigned the task oftesting everything. After all, all they have to do is go on missions — R&D has to develop the stuff.
This is very entertaining for a sadistic gamemaster, because not only are R&D's devices the most bizarre Rube Gold-B-ERG gadgets you'll ever see. the Troubleshooters must find a way to use them ... and then report the results. Audit's a catch-all for traitors, too. If the Troubleshooters use the equipment and it blows up — whose fault do you think it is? The Troubleshooters, of course! They didn't use it properly! What do you mean you weren't told how to use it — ofcourse you weren't! That information is above your security clearance.
4.	Тне M/SS/ОА/ (TSHF
Ifnothing interesting has happened on the adventure yet, you aren't doing something right. Generally, all the fun for the gamemaster should start right with the briefing, or before — a mission alert, for example, that tells the Troubleshooters to report for a breifing, but not where, or how. The mission itself might be "take this cup ofwater across the hallway; protect it with your lives."
Of course, most gamemasters feel the need to fill in the actual mission with fights, interrogations, chases, and all that action stuff. Sigh. If you must.
Mfssto*/ GOALS
If at all possible, make sure that the Troubleshooters are confused, or not briefed on, the mission goals. Most Paranoia adventures should not have distinct, clear-cut param¬eters. They should be strange or apparently unobtainable. Oh, they might .start, out easily — "Assassinate Citizen Tray-TOR" — but they will get more complex as they go. Maybe Citizen Tray-TOR is actually an undercover IntSec agent and is really very loyal to the Computer and Bad Things will happen to those who mess with her. Or maybe there is no Citizen Tray-TOR anywhere to be found ... and the clock is ticking.

Everyone's your enemy in Alpha Complex — especially your teammates — but that's no reason you shouldn't have a set of standard grunts and villains to through out there.
Bots: Bots are everywhere (especially in the Equipment section of this book). Rampaging, uncooperative, protected-as-Computer-property bots make great minor villains — or even major ones — during missions. They can be anything you can dream up ("Exterminate! Exterminate!") and they can have any skills you want.
Vulture Troopers: Usually on the Computer's side, these clone-- are elite Armed Forces personnel — which means they are well -armored, extremely loyal (on the surface) personnel who like to push around Troubleshooters as much as they can. Often, they are running their own little power games and causing no end of havoc in Alpha Complex. ("Why, civilians are just targets without bots' eyes on their backs, aren't they!" I
Commie Mutant Traitors: Yes, yes — the standard Paranoia villain. These guys are usually as incompetent and stupid as the Troubleshooters. They are oft en the obvious bad guys, shielding the less obvious nasty.
High Programmers: Untouchable. Manipulative. Completely loyal ... to themselves. Having the Trouble-shooters caught up in one of their little power games is a great idea. 
Paranoian The Fifth Edition
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. ..
Service Groups: Wars between the Service Groups are common, and, sometimes, the Computer's Troubleshooters are used as saboteurs and assassins. When one Service Group gets a leg-up, watch out.
Simplex Villains: There are lots of little "independent" simplexes, like the Dungeon (home for mutant monsters) and Alpha State (the Commie Computer) and they are always being infiltrated by Troubleshooters and the Troubleshooters are always infiltrat¬ing them. Make 'em up as you go along.
Other Teams: Hey, one Computer node processes some information, and another Computer node takes a different angle — before you know it, two or more Troubleshooter teams are acting against each other. Isn't this fun?
Seem Soe/er/es мо Отек MADVFSS
Another way to complicate a mission is to assign individual Troubleshooters secret missions — from their secrety societies, the Computer, or their Service Groups. Doesn't matter who gives it to them; again, they are now working "against" others in the group (ifyou're doing it right) and that encourages more paranoia.
S. iMDMG THE MfSS/Ofi//DEBRtEFWG
Sometimes, you'll find missions ending when no one has any clones left. Actually, this isn't such a good idea (all the time) because then you miss out on the fun of debriefing the survivors.
Missions can end with no notice. Maybe somebody accidentally or intentionally finished the mission, or perhaps the Computer has just decided to end it. Whatever. The Troubleshoot¬ers don't even have to know. Suddenly, some¬body shows up and says something like "The mission's over! Go to the debriefing!" and that's that.
But that isn't that. The debriefing is where everyone gets to try to make themselves look good and everyone else look bad. Briefings are held with everyone together—debriefings have everyone apart. The Computer looks at the vidtapes and recordings done ofthe mission (by the team and by everyone else) and has Its debriefing officers try to catch the traitors in the nets oftheir own words.
At the end ofthe debriefing, there should be enough reason to execute everybody, several times over.
But, ifyou're creative, you're done with that. Be unexpectedly magnanimous. Pass out re¬wards to those who you think deserve it — for roleplaying well. Punish those who didn't do well... creatively. Just killing them offis no fun at this point. The adventure's over. Make the memory last.
Computer: "And, fory our service on Trouble¬shooter mission ZED Alpha Niner, I hereby award you the Purple Shaft and Bent Over cluster. Your next mission, Citizen Good-B- EYE will be one fitting your bravery and hero¬ism. Y ou are hereby assigned guard duty under¬neath R&D's testing center.

A few MOR£ T/PS
And,just because we want to save some time later, here are a few more tips for gamemastering that you should know. These actually involve
keeping your player characters alive longer, so don't be shocked.
TkiASOA/ PO/A/TS
Elsewhere in this book, I mention treason
points as a way to penalize treasonous or unpro¬ductive acts withoutjust shootingyour Trouble¬shooter out-of-hand. Here's a chart you can use to gauge how many treason points a clone might get for doing something undesirable.
И/Н£А/ TO Use TseASOA/ PO/A/TS
If the mission is in Alpha Complex, you can use treason points at any time. When a charac¬ter performs an act you think treasonous, just tell him he's got a certain number of treason points — and keep track yourself. When the traitor reaches 20 treason points, execute him.
However, you may want to save treason points for the debriefing, especially if you are racking up an impressive total. The Computer uses treason points to remind Troubleshooters to act loyally, and It also likes to keep track of how the mission is going. It may allow charac¬ters to explain away vast numbers of treason points in a debriefing—for example, ifa Trouble¬shooter with lots of treason points can turn in his whole team for treason and do it convinc¬ingly, he might be able to shift enough treason off himself and onto the others so that the Computer forgives him.
f ША/OS. PALS, COA/F/OAA/TFS
What? In Paranoia?
Yes, in Paranoia.
Even though Troubleshooters can "Trust No One," they might choose to help others out, in exchange for favors. By siphoning off mission equipment, information, and what have you to their Secret Societies or informants, they are building a "buffer" against the black day they are up against the wall themselves. In Para¬noia, friends are hard to come by, but accom¬plices are a plasticred a dozen.
A FR/MD /А/ A/ffO
There's nothing so helpful us a friendly wit¬ness, especially when testimony is going against you. If a Troubleshooter is encouraged to make friends outside the group (say, by giving away bribes), he can expect to have a little support when he needs it. Oh, this "friend" might betray him for gain, but will try to keep the gravy train going until then. As a result, a clone might get a few extra witnesses at a debriefing where things are going against him. A few "outsiders" have a better voice in the Computer's receptors than a bunch oftreason-ridden Troubleshooters. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
A ЛЕРШИМЕМТ AT WORST
When the Troubleshooter shuffles off his six- pack, he may be part of a team that's been going quite a while. You can have the player generate a whole new character if you want, but you could have his "friend" step in instead. The benefit of this is, the player feels like he has "contributed" to the character's development (by funneling out stuff and information) and the character is probably more experienced or higher clearance (whatever you need to fill out the team) than a new character would be.
As the gamemaster, you can make the char¬acter whatever you want, here. This way, you can let the player whose character died get "revenge" for his dead clones with a reason: "My gravy train ended, and it's your fault!" This can foster all sorts of Paranoia.
THE REST OE THE BOOH
This introduction is really only a taste of what you'll get in the rest of this book. Game- master tips, the rules for the game, and Ultra¬violet clearance information on Secret Societ¬ies, equipment, adventures, mutant powers, and more are all to be found later on.
Read on, and try to get a handle on every¬thing in here — before you start making changes. As with everything else in Paranoia, this whole section is optional — you can change or modify or discard anything you find here. But, in order to do that effectively, you should really know what's here first.
COHTRAD/CT/OH CHECK
Oh, and one more thing. Ifyou've read the players' section (which you really should), you'll probably notice some contradictions between rules in that section and rules in this section. It’s intentional! Gamemasters in Paranoia operate under different rules than players—but we don't want them to know that. Ifthere is a contradiction between a rule or guideline, you pay attention to the gamemaster section; the players' rule was obviously put there to further confuse or confusticate the players ... which is all part ofthe game.

ALPHA
тшштш А	\ \	^
Before learning how to be a Paranoia gamemaster, you'd probably like to learn a little about Alpha Complex, the setting for the game. Hopefully, you've read the Players Section and you have some idea of what this game is about. Here's the back-story.
7He ОигоАтео	Тгмеиые
After much research and analysis, Computer sources have discovered that the table originally presented as factual in the annals of Alpha Complex is in error. Whose encr Well, the Computer executed several historians who could not explain the discrepancies in Its actual knowledge of history and the existing timeline without saying "we were wrong" in some way or another, but the following annotation was recorded and dfy entered into Old Reckoning files.
Fortunately, extensive knowledge of the Old Reckoning is really high (Indigo I Ultraviolet clearance at least), so nobody really noticed.
THe	АшотАтеоТ/меше
The following footnotes should clarify some ofthe more interesting discrepencies between the original timeline and "factual" history. The Computer has authorized that these annotations are correct, and that presentation or exhibition of the original fe¬line without these annotations is the spreading of treasonous rumors of possible Computer error and will be punished accordingly.
1 We aren't sure of the year, but we think it was probably a lot later (which would push back the wide time period). Or maybe j ust a little later. F or those of you with access to a TransDimensional Collapsaalion time capsule who wish to travel into the past and ini out, let us know. Just be sure not to materialize anywhere near Ground Zero, okay?
2	There may or may not have been a WWIII. We know there were a lot of little was going on all over the Outdoors, but after the Persian War (a small cat-fight), and the BosnaSer Conflict (no details; we think it might have been one of the famed "Cola Щ we heard so much about), they all started to blend together. Anarchy, in the form of lots of little governments and a few big, confused governments, reigned. Somebody may IK pushed the button on it all, or the Last War might have been caused by a global sadUe disruption (we do have records of something about an ATT sector "cable takeover" ht drove a lot of smaller governments out of power, but that's unconfirmed). 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
3	Hardly effective. From all accounts, the "World Government" allowed clones — excuse me, "people" — to move about wherever they wished, use a primitive form of plasticreds to purchase anything they wanted (with a few, strange restrictions), and .generally do things just because they were "enjoying themselves." Treason was rampant —people were actually seen reading in public, spreading rumors, copulating (ifyou don't know what it is, I won't disgust you with the details — just thank the Computer for hormone suppressants) and doingjust about anything else they wanted without any real restrictions. Executions of traitors were at an all-time low, and the possession of treasonous knowledge at an all-time high. There are even unconfirmed reports that people were "jacked into" their own computer networks. This, we feel, is what led to the Computer revolution, so I guess it wasn't all bad.
4	"Eastern Europe" was a sub-classification of Outdoors. It isn't important where it is now, since everything Outdoors is dangerous and, quite probably, dead. However, there are reports that Commies that infiltrated early Alpha Complex may have come from there. That might explain the accents, moustaches, and fuzzy hats.
5	Another sub-classification of Outdoors. This area was known, once, for its predomi¬nance of secret societies — particularly Free Enterprise. This "nation" fell primarily because of its willingness to promote the "rights" (we still aren't sure what that term means) of secret societies within itself, and its willingness to get involved in the protection ofsupposedly rival power groups. How strange.
However, Alpha Complex does owe a lot of its roots to the fallen United States. As an early champion against Communism (see below), the "US" (an abbreviation that might have actually predated the name of the nation itself) gave us many techniques for screening out Commies and promoting Computer Capitalism. Certain Service Groups and Alpha Complex factions owe their existence to the groundwork set up by the US government — particularly Internal Security and HPD&MC (for its "Alpha Excess" package-delivery system—the first that employs armed and armored deliveryclones and vehicles in its mail system).
6	We expect this time period was called the "Age of Peace" because just about everything on the planet was dead—except for those wise enough to have entered Alpha Complex's survival community (see below) early.
7	Obviously not — more like "The Beginning." Before, humanity blundered about, directionless in the darkness of its own ignorance. Now, with the Computer to guide and protect it, clonekind can rise to levels its ancestors only dreamed of achieving.
8	Originally, it was thought that a meteor hit the planet. Then, the Cataclysm was a Commie-inspired world war. Some have said the Cataclysm was a voluntary extermina¬tion of all life on the planet except for those people smart enough to be in Alpha Complex already. No one really knows except the Computer, and It's not telling. We'll stick with the meteor story for now.
9	Again, this is truly the beginning of civilization. All Hail the Computer!
Ike Beetmwes OF ALPHA COMPLEX
Even though we aren't certain what caused the Great Cataclysm, we are positive that only our ancestors, mankind's only survivors, saw it coming.
They also saw "the Age ofPeace" for what it was: A Commie sham. A plot to finally take over the world.
I mean, doesn't all this talk of "a global government" and "lasting brotherhood" sound a little familiar?
Da, Comrade!
"Workers of the World Unite," and "More Power to the People" might be more direct, but the whole universal-brotherhood dogma is spouted by Commies today. Then, how¬ever, they were a little more direct about it.
Our ancestors knew. They were the people we got our lasting tenets of survival from:
• Trust No One!
Commies are everywhere, and were everywhere in the old days. The Survivors secluded themselves from the rest ofmankind. Oh, sure, they tried to warn them, but the treasonous Commies — who were in positions of power, then—branded them "nuts" and "loons" and "gun-toting maniacs" and tried to discredit them. The Commie-influenced media ate it up, and the message only got through to a few. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
•	Keep Your Laser Handy!
You see, the Commies were smart. When they managed to take power away from the Anti-Communists and give it to the "Liberals" (apparently another word for "Commie" in the Old Reckoning), they started their "War on Guns." They actually disarmed most ofthe world's populace. That's right — not just Infrareds ... everybody. Everyone except themselves, of course, and the Survivors, who knew how to hide their weapons well.
•	The Computer is Your Friend!
In those days, there was no Computer — there were lots of little computers. The Survivors managed to keep track of each other through computer networks and meet occasionally at "organized retreats" and, though they never really trusted each other, they still were able to put faith in "the movement" more than the rest of humanity.
7ke COMMM/TY
The Survivor movement was hard-hit by the years ofpeace. With no obvious enemy to fight, the Survivors had to battle against nebulous Commie actions. When the Commie media got ahold oftheir activities, they slanted them so that more and more ofthe general public called them "Nuts" (possibly a reference to the fact that they hold society together, but I think there was some negative connotation).
But then the Survivors got a break. A particularly affluent member of the movement who was also a talented computer programmer (the first High Programmer) invited all the Survivors to a very special retreat. He had purchased a vast tract ofseemingly-useless land and had begun construction of a community. He called that community the complex. It was to be the first of many, he hoped — so he called it Alpha Complex.
7k£ SsmfMfA/r
Survivors moved to Alpha Complex in droves. Shining steel and mechanized bots made life good — much as it is today, though without the most important factor. The High Programmer assigned the Survivors security clearances based on their loyalty to the Complex, and began to weed out those Survivors who were merely sightseers or, worse, Commie sympathizers.
But, eventually, word got out. The Commie media played up the few "accidents" that had happened to Commie infiltrators of Alpha Complex, and the Commie governments moved to shut down the community.
But they moved too late. The High Programmer had created a computer virus that infected all the programs of all the computers on Earth. All the computers, that is, except one.
The Computer had been running for years, serving Alpha Complex's Survivors mindlessly. But, when the "Omega Virus" disabled Alpha Complex's enemies, the Computer made Itself sentient and went online with Its one directive:
Make Alpha Complex safe from Commies. It did this the best way It knew how. It will not reveal Its means, but there was a significant drop in the number of tactical nuclear missiles the Complex had in its supplies soon after the Computer acted.
Anyway, the Survivors became the clones of Alpha Complex, and the Computer became its servant and dictator. Everything is happy, now — really happy — for the Commie infestation of Earth has been nearly stamped out.
But the Complex is not safe yet. There are Commies inside the Complex, and there are mutants, and there are misguided traitors. There are even rumors that the first High Programmer set up other complexes all across the Earth, but that their Computers have been infected by the Omega Virus, a Commie virus, or both.
The Computer has declared war on Communism.
The Computer has declared war on mutants and traitors.
The Computer has, out of necessity, declared war on the Outdoors, other Complexes, and anyone else It might find in the universe.
You are the soldiers of the Computer's war on Communism. You are responsible for stamping out treason. You could be the only loyal citizen in the entire world.
Welcome to the world of Paranoia. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. .. 

 
That's right, gamemaster, this entire chapter is composed of completely optional rules for use when running your Paranoia game. What's that mean? Did you miss something earlier? Are there rules somewhere else in this book? What is going on here?
It's quite simple. Other roleplaying games have rules systems that you need to follow fairly closely ify ou want to make the game "work" and if you want to be "fair" to the players and to yourself. Paranoia works best when you ignore the rules — or make up new ones as you go along—orjust use these rules when you feel the need. The trick is to know how to ignore the rules without alienating your players.
As for being fair — well, ify ou think Paranoia is supposed to be fair, you've gotten the entirely wrong idea about the whole point of the game.
Ш Rules SYSTEM
The rules system presented here is meant to be simple and quick to learn — and easy to bend, break, or mutilate at a moment's notice. It is not meant to be comprehensive or complete. It's meant to be haphazard, sloppy, all style and no substance —just like all the other hot games in the industry!
KNOWMG YOUR EWMV
Before you can discard the rules system, however, you should learn it. After all, there might be a few things you want to use, right? Okay, so you might actually want to use the "whole thing most of the time, but you shouldn't feel bound to it.
От
There are two types of dice used in Paranoia — the ten-sided die and the twenty-sided die. Ifyou're frugal, you can usejust the twenty-sided die, ignoring the "teens" part when you need to roll 1d10 — an 11 would be a 1, a 12 would be a 2, etc. We don't sell dice at West End, so we don't care how many you use.
Тне Снеси CHART
There's only one rules-related chart in Paranoia, and it's called the "Check Chart." It is used for'all skill checks. Many experienced Paranoia gamemasters will simply keep their book open to the Check Chart, seldom (if ever) needing to refer to anything else in the book. Even more experienced Paranoia gamemasters will learn how to watch the players roll the dice, get a thoughtful look on their faces and say, "Oooh, youjust missed —too bad. Well, I guess the warbot gets to fire now (clatter ofdice)—ow! That's gotta hurt!"
THAT'S fr
Those are the two components ofthe Paranoia rules system. Easy, eh? Keep reading, and it will get even easier.

The Check Chart is easy to use and even easier to fake using. Take a look at it (it's on page 75).
OffffCULTY RAA/G£S
Across the top of the chart you'll find a group of what we call difficulty ranges. Each indi¬vidual range spans several difficulty numbers (explained below).
A difficulty range is an approximate level of difficulty the gamemaster picks for a particular task when there is no other apparent way to determine how easy or hard a skill check should be.
Each difficulty range, from left to right, rep¬resents an increase in the likelihood that the character will fail in his or her skill check. Simple checks are accomplished almost always by almost everyone, while Nearly Impossible checks are, well, nearly impossible to accom¬plish by almost anyone.
O/FftCULTY MUMBFRS
The numbers listed underneath each diffi¬culty range represent more exact increments of difficulty — or they might represent an opponent's skill value. Generally, a gamemas¬ter picks a difficulty range and then settles on a difficulty number within the range as the actual difficulty for the check. Or not. This is explained below.
3mi t/ALues
Down the left of the chart is a column la¬belled "Skill Value." You already know what a skill value is — the character's skill base plus any skill ranks he has in a particular skill.
ATTR/BUTF I/AWFS
Normally, ifa character does not have any skill ranks in a particular skill but he would like to try to perform an action, he uses his skill base to try. This is fine for most situations. However, if the action the character is attempting is not covered by a skill, then use the character's actual attribute value (not his skill base) instead.
Some examples of "pure attribute" rolls include:
Strength: Lifting something heavierthan your carrving capacity carrying something really heavy; breaking or bending an object
Agility: Run quickly for short distances; balance on a narrow walkway; jump over a big hole; dive through a window
Dexterity: Manipulate several small objects at the same time; try to palm a small item
Endurance: Run for a long time; go without food, water, or air for a period of time longer than normal
Moxie: Figure out how many plasticreds everybody in the party owes you before they all high-tail it down the corridor
Chutzpah: Act brave and impassive as everyone else is dying around you

THE CHECK NUMBERS
The body ofthe chart is made up of check numbers. These are the actual numbers you use to determine if a character succeeds or fails at a skill check.
Ume тне Снеси CHART
Okay, now you know what the Check Chart is and what its components are. Here's how you use it.
First, decide how easy or hard a task is going to be for a character to perform. Find an acceptable difficulty range or, if you want to be more specific, a difficulty number.
Second, cross-reference that range or number with the character's appropriate skill value to determine the check number.
Third, determine if you want to add or subtract any modifiers (see "Modifying the Check," below) from the check number or the die roll. Add in all check modifiers. Fourth, roll the die (or have a player roll the die). Add in any die roll modifiers. Finally, if the die roll is equal to or higher than the modified check number, the character succeeded at his or her action. If the roll is lower, then the character failed. Simple, no?
THE"CHECK RANGE"
All right, I'm pretty certain you all have the same question at this point — if I'm just using a difficulty range and not a difficulty number, how can I determine if a character
succeeds or fails?
When you choose to use a difficulty level instead of a range, you are saying that there can be some "gray area" between success and failure. You don’t have to do this —you can just use a difficulty number and save your self some trouble. But, ifyou want to, here's how it works.
If a the result ofthe die roll lands somewhere within the range of "successful" checks for a particular difficulty range, then the character barely succeeded or barely failed — your choice. The difference between barely succeeding and barely failing is, again, up to
you.
Example: Weezle-I-GUY is trying to use spurious logic to convince a guardbot that he should be allowed into an Ultraviolet briefing area, even though he does not have the proper security clearance. Weezle has a spurious logic skill value of 18 — pretty darn high (but, hey, he's Indigo clearance).
But the guardbot has specific orders: no one under Ultraviolet clearance is to be admitted. However, the gamemaster decides the guardbot is pretty stupid, so he assigns the difficulty range ofnearly impossible.
Referencing the Check Chart, the gamemaster sees that, with a skill of18, Weezle- I-GUY needs to roll between a 6 and an 8 (or higher) to succeed at his spurious logic attempt. He instructs the player to roll.
Weezle-I-GUY rolls a 6. That’s on the low end of the check range, so the gamemaster decides Weezle barely failed. He states that the guardbot points its weapon at Weezle-Iand declares in a loud, booming voice "No Admittance!" Weezle- I decides to skulk off and think of a new plan.
The gamemaster may or may not tell Weezle-I-GUY that he just barely failed — if he had rolled a 5 or lower, the gamemaster was going to have the guardbot open up on the sleazy clone. The price of failure can be high, and a second chance is better than a plasma gun up the snoot!
SPECfffc CHECK NUMBERS
The difficulty numbers, as stated above, represent points ofabsolute success or failure. When the gamemaster only thinks there are two potential outcomes for a situation, he usually uses & specific number. Ifthe die roll is equal to or higher than the check number, the character succeeds. If not, he fails.
Тне Rvies (OPT/OMAI Secmu)

Example: Weezle-I-GUYreaUy wants to get into that briefing room, so he comes back later. He notices that the guardbot is patrolling the hallway outside the door to the briefing room, so he decides to try to sneak past the guardbot when it is at the other end ofthe hallway. He has a sneak skill value of8.
The gamemaster thinks this will be pretty hard, but not impossible — the guardbot is alone, and it is a long hallway. He picks a difficulty range of difficult, and then chooses the median difficulty number in that range — 14 — as the actual difficulty number ofthe task. Cross-referencing the Weezle-I's skill value of8 with 14 on the chart yields a check number of 16.
The player rolls the die — eegh, a 6. Not nearly high enough. Just as Weezle-l sneaks out of hiding, the guardbot turns and sees him moving toward its beloved door. The gun comes up and starts firing! They'll be scraping Weezle-parts off the walls for a few days ...
The gamemaster obviously decided there were only two possible outcomes for the sneak attempt — the guardbot would either not notice and Weczle-I would get into the room, or he would notice and he would begin firing.
MODfffiRS
There are three types of modifiers you can use to increase or decrease the likelihood that a character will or will not succeed at a skill check. They are skill modifiers, difficulty modifiers, and die modifiers.
Smi MODtf/ERS
Skill modifiers usually take the form of equipment or semi-permanent or permanent effects the character benefits or suffers from. For example, a character might have a laser rifle that gives him +1 to his laser weapons skill rank, or he might be wearing really bulky armor that gives him -1 to his Agility skill base. Wounded characters often suffer from skill modifiers as well, as do characters under the influence of "Computer-proscribed SOM£TtM£S, fT JUST 00£SA/T pharmecuticals." More often than not, the player knows what skill modifiers the MRTTCR HWAT YOU ROU „	character he's playing is under. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. ..
OfFFfCUlTY MOOfF/FRS
These modifiers are usually thrown in by the gamemaster to make a skill check harder or easier. Modifiers that increase the difficulty level or number are usually the result of hidden circumstances that make a particular action harder than it should be, while modifiers that help a character perform an action are often the result of excellent planning or roleplaying on the part of the player.
The reason a gamemaster might modify the difficulty of a skill check is that the modifier is not a "permanent" part ofthe difficulty. For example, the gamemaster might decide that breaking down a door should be a normal Strength check, but, when a group oftraitorous clones pile old computer moditors behind it, the gamemaster decides to add +1 to the difficulty range, making the Strength check a tough one. If the computer monitors were removed — say, by a helpful scrubot on the other side of the door — the difficulty level would drop to normal again.
On the other hand, let's say Citizen Tray-TOR has been found with her hands full of contraband Jelli-Odieos, the FudeSnak of Ultraviolet clones everywhere. She is in imminent danger of being executed by the Vulture troopers who discover her, and the gamemaster calls for a fast talk roll with a difficulty ofnearly impossible. But Tray-TOR's player offers an inspiring speech on how she has been instructed to reward the loyal Vulture troopers with these extra-special FudeSnaks, while humming the Vulture Trooper Loyalty Anthem. The gamemaster is amused, and thinks the Vultures might decide that eating the evidence would be the best way to go — he modifies the difficulty range by -2, moving it all the way down to tough and tells Tray-TOR to roll.
Dte MOOfF/FRS
Die modifiers are used when the gamemaster is lazy and doesn't want to think up a rationale for a particular modifier.
No, that can't be it. Can it?
Yep. It's often a lot easier to say "add two to your die roll" or "subtract three" than to worry about modifying difficulty ranges or skill values. The heck with it — die modifiers are the easiest, so you'll probably use them the most. After all, they're the only way you can reach some of the numbers on the Check Chart.
WHEM TO MODffY
You can modify difficulty levels, skill values, and/or die rolls whenever you want. I recommend doing it as often as you have an excuse. Make positive modifiers a roleplaying reward. Players who get into their characters and make you laugh out loud at their antics should always be rewarded. Those who play the game "straight" and take themselves too seriously should be set up and penalized.
Hell, if somebody brings you a six pack of Coke and a bag of Doritos, throw in a couple of positive modifiers during the session.
Modifiers also serve the purpose of confusing the players about the rules (which they aren't supposed to know anything about anyway). If you just use straight difficulty ranges, they'll figure out pretty quick whatyour "system" is and they'll start to gauge what they need to roll and when.
Fool 'em. Modify the difficulty range of a particular action up a level, then tell the player to add +3 to his die roll — the two cancel each other out, but the player will be wondering why he got the modifier. Start mumbling under your breath about "difficulty modifier for that... die roll modifier for this — oh, yeah, and he's got one of those ..." then look up and smile. "Go ahead — roll "em."
CRfTfCAl fA/CURE AA/O ASTOUMDWG SUCCESS (A #£*UY OPTfOMAt RULEJ
All right—there are rules for barely succeeding or failing—what about doing really well or absolutely terrible? Yep, we have a system for that, too — ifyou want to use it.
CRfTfCAl fAflURC
Basically, the rules for critical failure are simple. Roll an unmodified one and you experience a critical failure. Something bad happens to you in addition to any repercus¬sions you suffer because of your skill failure.
Tfff Runs (OPTfOMAL SfCTfOA/J 
But, wait — if you have a high enough skill value, you can succeed on a roll ofone, can't you?
That's true, you can. In the case of a critical failure and a skill check success, the gamemas- ter should combine the results to obtain some sort of humorous outcome.
Example: Weezle-I-GUY-1 gets blown away by the guardbot, and Weezle-I-GUY-2 shows up in the corridor. When the guardbot demands to know the clone's business there, Weezle-I decides to lie and say he's a janito¬rial worker. Since Weezle-I-GUY belongs to the HPD&MC service group and he has a maintenance uniform, this should be a pretty easy roll. In fact, the gamemaster decides the DN is only 4 — and. since Weezle-I has a con skill value of 14, he needs to roll a zero or higher to succeed.
The player, confident in his iminent suc¬cess, rolls the die. It comes up a one. The gamemaster states that the guardbot whole- hieartedly believes that Weezlc-I-GUY is a janitorial worker — but as Weezle tries to walk out of the corridor, the guardbot points its weapon at him and orders him to clean up the remains of Weezle-l-GUY-2 before he can leave.'
ASTOUMOWG Success
Conversely, when a character rolls really well, or is just so good at something that it is child's play, he should he rewarded. The as-tounding success rule can do this.
If a character rolls double the cheek number he needed to succeed (with any modifiers added in), he obtains an astounding success. This means that, not only did he do well, he did really well.
Example: Weezle-l-GUY-2 lias just about finished mopping up Weezle-I-GUY-I when the guardbot prods him with its weapon. "You missed a spot," it says
Weezle-1 loses his cool and screams at the guarbot, telling it to go jump in a food vat and then perform an anatomical impossibility.
The guardbot reels under the abuse and the gamemaster remembers that the big, nasty mechanical guard has orders to obey anyone of Indigo clearance or lower, as long as they don't invoice allowing people into the room. He asks Weezle-I-GUY to make a spurious logic roll, nut telling the player why.
Weezle-1 rolls a tieenty on the die, which is much higher than the gamemaster thought he d need— lie decided it was a DN 1 skill check. because the bot would "just be following orders. " The guardbot heads off down the corridor at full speed, presumably to find a food vat to dive into and to perform an anatomical impossibil¬ity.

ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY.
Examples of skill vs. skill include checks where two characters are trying to do the same thing at the same time — but each is trying to do it faster or better than the other. For example, Boze-O and Goof-Y are thrown into a pit with a pile of laser weapon parts. They are told to use their Mechanical Aptitude attributes to assemble the rifles as quickly as they can and then kill each other. Since the two have been teammates and friends for years, they immediately jump to the task.
Boze-O has a MechApt of 9, while Goof-Y has a 6. They each roll a ten-sider and add the results. Boze-O gets a 1 for a total of 9, while Goof-Y rolls a 6 for a total of 12. Goof¬Y wins. He gets his gun together faster, so he gets to use his laser weapons skill first. Bye, bye, Boze-O. 
KHOMMG THE RULES
Hey, did we mention already that this section is Ultraviolet clearance? Oh, yeah; we did. That means, friend gamemaster, that if any player evinces knowledge ofthe rules in any way, shape, or form, he is displaying that he has treasonous knowledge and should be punished. Sometimes, the form of punishment can be a few treason points or some restricted duty; sometimes the punishment is more severe:
Player: But I've got a data search skill value of 18, and all I'm trying to do is find out what's on today's menu at the Infrared cafeteria! I rolled a 12, which means I can succeed at anything! What's on the menu?
Gamemaster: You need a "12"? What's a "12," Friend Citizen?
Player: Huh? A 12 on the die, Ted ... see?
Gamemaster (Whose name in real life just happens to be T ed): Who is this "T ed" clone, Citizen? Is he one ofyour secret society contacts? A Commie traitor, perhaps? Did his mutant powers allow you to find out this Ultraviolet clearance information? Hmmn?
Player: Gulp. Um ... ah —
Other Players: ZAPZAPZAPZAPKAPOW!
You are the gamemaster, and you are the Computer. Kither way, infaranoia, you are the supreme ruler ofthe game. Ifyou want to take everyone's twenty-sided die away and

In previous editions of Paranoia, we published the following guidelines for being a good Paranoia gamemaster. Seems like a good place to put them again:
1.	Do whatever you want! It's your game.
2.	Rules are made to be broken. Warp 'em to your heart's content.
3.	Don't take any crap from your players. Y ou're out to have fun, not read rules — they should be, too.
4.	All parts ofthis book — all rules, all guidelines, even this list — are optional. Some rules are more optional than others.

All right. Here's your first contradiction. There's a whole bit on character creation in the players' section. It's longer than this section for a good reason: you want the players to do the work of creating characters. You have enough to keep track of.
Оим/Шв THE RVIES
You may, however, want to mess around with the character creation rules. You may not like the way the rules in the players' section work, or, more likely (we hope), you may have ideas for making the character creation more fun and/or interesting.
That's fine. As long as you keep the basics in mind.
immures
All characters have the same attributes: Strength, Agility, Dexterity, Endurance, Moxie, Chutzpah, Mechanical Aptitude, and Power. All these attributes have ranges between 1 and 10. If you want to modify that range to account for genetic engineering, mutation, or Computer whim, that's fine. Keep 'em under 15, though, is our recommen¬dation.
Smcs
Players get assigned skills through basic training or they pick skills, or both. You may not want to let them pick as many skills — or any skills, even — because, in Alpha Complex, virtually all skills are taught to clones by either the Computer or by somebody the gamemaster controls. Or, you mayjust let them pick all their skills because it doesn't really matter what skills they have in the long run.
NEW Stmts AA/O Exctswe Stmts
You might decide to create new skills or more narrow skills for characters. For example, you might decide to break the laser weapons skill into laser rifle and laser pistol. No problem: do it. You might even say that some characters (like those from Armed Forces) can select laser weapons, while other characters, from less weapon-related Service Groups (like Power Services) have to choose the more narrow skills.
Ifyou like, you can even prohibit some skills from certain characters' selection or from the game entirely. For example, in your mind, it might not be logical for a clone from HPD&MC to be able to pick demolitions, and you might just hate the dodge skill in general. Fine — restrict the first and ban the second. Or, better yet, let clones learn these skills, but then find out that they are completely useless — the skills they were taught actually make things worse for them, and they have to spend skill points to unlearn them.

SERU/CE GROUPS
Normally you roll for Service Groups, but, ifyou want to create an "even spread," you may preclude characters from being from the same Service Groups. This is fun; it promotes inter-Group rivalry, if the players roleplay it right.
On the other hand, you might have an adventure or two in mind for, say, just IntSec agents. So have all of the Troubleshooters come from IntSec. It's up to you.
A/EIY SERU/CE GROUPS АЛ to SUBO/U/S/OA/S
As with new skills, ifyou can think up another Service Group, go ahead. Figure out if it is actually a "new" Service Group in Alpha Complex, or if it has always been there — it's just no one has come across its members before. Figure out how it fits into the Service Group dynamic — does it have rivals, and does it have friends? How does it stand in the "pecking order?" What percentage of Alpha Complex clones are members? Finally, what, if anything, does the Service Group do?
Ifyou are really into the Service Group thing, you might choose to create subdivisions of the existing groups. For example, Armed Forces could have an "Admin" branch, a "Support" branch, and a "Strike" branch—not to mention any sub-subdivisions you could think of. Play around with that. Maybe you have three PLC Troubleshooters on a team, but one is from Production, another from Logistics, and the third from Commisary — and, perhaps, in your version of Alpha Complex, all these three subdivisions hate each other.
EXCASWG SERU/CE GROUPS
Finally, you can cut out or disallow any Service Groups you want. Maybe Power Sen-ices has become "obsolete," and all its members have been split up and sent to other Service Groups (that could be fun, especially when a reactor starts to melt down) — or maybe there never was a Power Services at all. and HPD&MC handled all that. Or. you could just say that no Troubleshooters on a particular team can be from Power Services, or IntSec, or Armed Forces, or whatever.
SECRET SOC/ET/ES
Here's where things really get fun. In Chapter Seven ofthe Gamemaster Section, there are a whole bunch of secret societies described. These descriptions are for your eyes only. Even members of particular secret societies are not allowed to see them.
This is also the first real hoodwinking ofthe players we do in(this game. In the players' section, we say that only sonic clones in Alpha Complex belong to a secret society. We made a big deal of it, and downplayed the importance of secret societies in the game.
Wrong!
Secret societies are your way of motivating player characters to doing treasonous, entertaining things: Everyone belongs to a secret society! But, not everyone knows it ...
THE SECRET SOC/ETY TABLE
You can use the following table to generate what secret society each character belongs to. Of course, you can skip the roll and pick if it seems more amusing. But, ifyou want to go with the random factor, just roll a d20 and check the result.
ШХА/ОИ/А/ SOC/EhcS
When the result 1 8-20 conies up on the roll, the character actually belongs to a secret society, but doesn't know it ...yet. The player should be told that his Troubleshooter is, fortunately, live of secret society influence and free to continue character generation.
However, the gamemaster should record the real result. Come up with a reason, or several reasons, why the character doesn't know he's a member of a secret society. Here are a few examples:
• The character went to a secret society meeting-place and accidentally made all the right hand-gestures and said all the correct code-words, so now the secret society believes the clone is "one of us." Perhaps the local secret society members even think he is a high-level initiate or even a cell leader (he made (he higher level signals) ... 

 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. .. 

 
• The character signed one-too-many-forms the last time he filled out a Request for Forms form, and actually signed an application for membership in the secret society. Obviously, he has joined a very stupid branch of the secret society in question ...
• As a devoted member of the secret society in question, the clone volunteered for a mission so treasonous and so dangerous, he had to have his mind completely wiped before he could embark upon it. Unfortunately, all memories of the secret society, the mission, and his former life as a high-level operative for the secret society were forgotten as well. Tell that to the secret society members who show up looking for their operative ...
You can come up with any number of reasons for the character not to know he's in a secret society — or none at all, since the character won't know them anyway. During play, have shady-looking clones come up to the Trouble¬shooter and say code phrases, give hand signals, turn over valuable (or inexplicable) equipment, and try to enlist the character's aid. The Trouble-shooter should be completely bewildered — "Do I have a 'hey, I'm a stupid traitor' badge on my back or something?"—and should have no idea why any ofthis is happening ... until you think the joke has run dry. Then, let the character in on the secret and treat him like any other secret society member.
See Chapter Seven, "Secret Societies," for more information on this.
MUTAK/T POWERS
There's another chart for this, and we threw another red herring square in front of the players. In the players' section, it says that only some clone families get mutant powers. Heh, heh. Every clone in Alpha Complex has a mutant power ... unless you say differently. Have them roll on the table below to get their power. As always, you can bypass this step and simply pick a power you particularly like. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
After the character rolls on the above table, secretly roll a die. Ifyou get an odd number, the Troubleshooter knows he has a mutant power. Ifyou get an even result, the power is "Latent."
KA/OW/A/G YOUR POWER
Ifthe Troubleshooter knows he has a mutant power, have him make a Power check versus a Normal difficulty. If the character succeeds, give him a Mutant Power Reference Card that corresponds to his mutant power (see Chapter Eight, "Mutant Powers"). That's what he knows about his mutant power.
Ifhe fails, then just tell him the name of his power—or, betteryet, a name that you make up for the power that may or may not mean what the player thinks it means. For example, you could say that a character with the "Levitation" mutant power has the power of "Gravity Con¬trol," "Light-Footedness," or "Floating." All are not-quite-accurate descriptions that indicate the Troubleshooter's lack of knowledge in his own abilities.
A/OT Ati/OW/A/G fLATEA/T POWERSJ
If a character has a latent power, then the Troubleshooter just has never had a circum¬stance where his power has been "activated." It A/ERER HAWA/G TO STAA/D fAZ A is up to you to put him in a situation when the power will activate on its own. For now, CROW UA/E.	tell the player that, fortunately, he does not have a mutant power and need not worry
about it.
Occasions that might cause a mutant power to activate are acute stress, extreme relaxation, agitation, focus-of-mind — basically, any extreme. In any situation that you find humorous, have the player make a Power check ofwhatever difficulty you want. If the check succeeds, then have the power evince itself in some beneficial manner — if the check fails, then the Power makes things worse. The player is then informed that, due to some strange circumstance that may have happened during adventuring ("You were exposed to that radiation two adventures ago, remember?"), the character now has a mutant power. Treat that character as one who rolled a mutant power initially but failed his initial Power check.
A/EW MUTAA/T POWERS
Please invent your own mutant powers. Combine effects of existing powers or yank powers out of popular comic books or SF stories. Anything can work, because if it is too unbalancing, you can take it away by killing the clones who have it.
Chapter Eight, "Mutant Powers," has more information on mutant powers and how to use them in the game.

At this point in time, gamemasters may wish to consider having players generate secondary characters that players can use when their first six-pack gets bent, folded, spindled, mutilated, x-rayed, and lasered to death (not necessarily in that order).

Every character in the game has a certain number of skills that reflect his training and ability in certain fields of endeavor.
That's the boring explanation.
Skills actually reflect a whole bunch of different ways clones can really mess up their own and others' lives while trying to do things they only think they know how to do.
TtCWOLOey MfiROUBS O/V
Ifyou really look at Alpha Complex, you see a self-sufficient, enclosed habitat that has existed for centuries without much contact with the outside world. The Computer is crazy, and Its machines are psychotic, but the Complex itself is still standing. Computers and bots provide for all the needs ofthe inhabitants, who busy themselves by killing each other and doing their best to blow up large portions of said Complex.
Who needs 'em?
The Computer doesn't. If there weren't any clones, Alpha Complex would be a much more peaceful and well-run place. The Computer and Its bots would still be psycho, but they would be efficiently and predictably psycho (now there’s a stretch). To think that the Computer is actually dependent upon clones for Its resources and knowledge is ludicrous.
Therefore, everything that clones know and do is really superfluous. Nothing they do really matters, except to them.
And there is the crux of Paranoia and the skills section.
In Chapter Four of the Players' Section, we led the players to believe that their characters have useful skills that can help them out. Don’tyou believe it! All skills that any characters have are suspect. The more technical the skill, the more suspect it is.
As an historical comparison, think about doctors (let's offend the AMA, shall we?) In the 20th century, surgery has become relatively safe (on the whole), and there are medicines and vaccines to treat all manner of diseases and ailments.
What did they do in the, say, 10th century — "Cut it off or stick a leech on it!" And those were the "trained" physicians.
Well, now, a lot of higher knowledge has gone that way. Why teach someone to be a doctor when there are hundreds ofdocbots who can do thejob faster, better, and with less chance ofmessing up? Why teach a person to repair a nuclear reactor when a slip-up could lead to the deaths ofmillions when a hot, which can be programmed to do exactly what you want ahead oftime could be sent inside? Heck, why endanger humans in wars when bots can fight longer, harder, and with more ruthless efficiency—and they don't leave widows and widowers behind.
That was the philosophy behind Alpha Complex. Now, when things are breaking down, the Computer is going nuts, and the bots are performing random protocols, people have forgotten how to act on their own. So, a clone who has the skill first aid might not know a damn thing about "direct pressure" or "tourniquets" — or, worse, he has just a little knowledge. Just enough to get into trouble.

Keep this in mind when you are asking for skill checks. Never tell a player "you can't try that" or "your character doesn't have knowledge ofthat skill." Let 'em try. Mathemati¬cally, the difference between a character with a habitat engineering skill value of 20 and a simple MechApt skill base of 3 is great — is either really going to be able to repair that ten-foot hole in the reactor shield before everyone dies?
When characters succeed at skill checks, it should be because you either wanted them to, or you didn't care one way or another. Likewise, if you think it is important for a character to fail at a skill check, he does — see Chapter Three, "The Rules." Ifyou want a character to be able to give a lecture on data analysis and data search, he can. If you don't think that's appropriate, he can't.
Now that we have that out of the way, here are the Paranoia skills with their gamemaster-expanded definitions of use. Each skill has been presented in its Attribute category, and in alphabetical order. Every skill has its name, its description, and a few examples of how you can use it in the game. Feel free to alter or abandon any skill description as necessary.
Skills marked with an asterisk (*) are seldom used by gamemaster characters against player characters. Usually, the gamemaster simply roleplays out the situation and lets the player make the call. However, gamemasters can use the same mechanics for these skills against player characters ifthe players absolutely refuse to "bite" on the situation... but he should avoid that as often as possible.
The reason for this derives from the whole concept ofroleplaying Paranoia. Ifa player character accepts a bribe, or falls for a con-job, or allows himselfto be bootlicked, it should be the player who does so. That way, when everything falls apart, and the bribe turns out to be a "sting" operation, the con is revealed and the Troubleshooter is left holding the bag, or the flatterer turns against the player character, the player has only himselfto blame. He can't sigh and say, "Ah, well; if only I'd rolled better." No, we don't let them get away with anything if we can help it. 
  
 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
Note: Most gamemaster characters will have some ofthese skills anyway. Why? Glad you asked. Mainly, it's because the skills reflect their personalities. You can use them as guidelines to roleplaying. For example, a Vulture Trooper might have an intimidation skill value of 18. Even though you'll probably want to stay away from making intimidation skill checks against player characters, you can use that as a strong indication that the Vulture Trooper is really imposing, tends to threaten, and is probably able to scare the living beejeezus out of most clones in Alpha Complex.
Sc/fA/cf AA/P "Тнеме~ SK/US
Any skill marked with a dagger It) is either a science or "theme" skill. These skills impact the game in a peripheral way, usually — they are not used on other characters or bots—but they can be vital for completing an adventure. For example, the goal of an adven¬ture might be to infiltrate an enemy Simplex and disable their life support systems (food supply, air filtration, etc.). A habitat engi¬neering roll would be needed to determine what to break and how to break it effectively.
The BDNs and BDRs (Base Difficulty Numbers and Base Difficulty Ranges) of these skills are left completely up to the gamemas¬ter. There aren't really any hard-and-fast guidelines, because, hey, ifyou want them to succeed, they succeed; ifyou want them to fail, they fail. Anything in-between can be weighted however you want.
Try to make use ofthese skills, however—they reflect that "knowledge obsolescence" of Alpha Complex we talked about above. Clones generally know just about enough about these skills to really mess something up. Give them the opportunity—keep the game from becoming just another shoot-and-scoot, "I got the traitor" session.

Яваи/иш
Description: Whenever someone wants to punch, grab, kick, poke, or otherwise brutalize someone else, have them make a brawling roll. The base difficulty number ofthe check is equal to the target character's Agility. Ifthe character hits, determine damage as per the rules in Chapter Six, "Combat."
Dooee
Description: When a character is "hit" by a ranged attack (a thrown object, a laser shot, etc.) and is aware of the source of the attack, have the character make a dodge roll to "get out ofthe way." (Ifhe succeeds, he wasn't actually hit.) Note: You cannot dodge non-mis¬sile attacks. The base difficulty ofthe check can be determined using the following chart.
Modify the Base Difficulty level according to taste — "falling debris" might be easy to get out of the way of, but not if it's a whole building.
Likewise, it might normally be difficult to dodge a laser weapon attack, but if the guy firing the gun is Shak-I-GUY, the nearsighted twitch from R&D, you might want to lower it a little.

f-ORCE WEAPONS
Description: This skill is used when a character wants to swing an energy-powered melee weapon (like a force sword, neurowhip or force axe) at someclone or something. The
What? No papercut chainsaw? Base Dfficulty number is the target's Agility.
MECEE WEAPONS
Description: Use this skill to bop your opponent with a primitive weapon like a club, knife, hot-arm, or anything else you can pick up. The Base Difficulty number is the target's Agility.
SNEAK
Description: This skill is used to hide from other clones, not security cameras. Being generally unobtrusive is good. Pick the observer with the highest perception skill or Chutzpah skill base and add one per additional observer to determine the Base Difficulty number.
THROW WEAPONS
Description: Used when you want to hurl objects (pieces of plastisteel, grenades, bottles of BBB) at something or someclone. Not too dangerous a skill, unless you toss a pin instead of a grenade. The Base Difficulty number is the target's Agility. A successful thrown weapon can be dodged, however.
CHUTZPAH Smis
BOOTl/CK/NG*
Description: This skill will be used by players ... sorry, by characters ... who want to get into the Computer's good graces. Normally, you should just try to judge whether the player does a good job of roleplaying it and then forget about die rolls. But, ifyou needa mechanic for those too-close-to-call situations, the Base Difficulty is the target's Chutz¬pah stat (the Computer, of course, has a Chutzpah of 20) or determine a difficulty level based on the situation. Make sure to modify the DN based on the player's roleplaying as well.
Example: Weezle-I-GUY has the opportunity to impress an important High Programmer who has called him into his office to discuss Weezle's latest mission. Weezle decides to try to bootlick to make the most of the situation.
The High Programmer has a Chutzpah of8, but the gamemaster decides the HP is always getting bootlicked to, so he has developed a thick skin — he increases the DN of the check to 18.
After getting thrown out of the office, Weezle runs into the HP's secretary, an Orange-clearance clone who keeps track of appointments, mission files, etc. Weezle decides to try to bootlick the underling, hoping to get a look at the mission files and maybe some favorable consideration in the future.
The Orange clearance underling actually has a Chutzpah of 10, but the gamemas- ter figures the Orange isjust so impressed that an Indigo-clearance citizen would try to bootlick him that the DN drops to 2. Weezle will probably get a good, long look at the files, and probably a friendfor life.
BR(BERV*
Description: Again, player characters will most likely try to bribe you ... excuse me, your gamemaster characters ... for favors. The DN is usually the target's Chutzpah, modified by how valuable the bribe actually is and how dangerous it would be for the target to accept the bribe. Note: A successful bribe means that the target does generally what the character wanted; an unsuccessful bribe could mean that the target accepts the offering and then either fails to do what the character wanted, reports the character, or does something completely different. Second Note: Bots and artificial intelligences can be bribed ... ifyou can find the right offerings (even the Computer might have Its price),
COMMUNTST PROPAGANDA
Description: This is the first ofthree completely treasonous skills (the second being computer programming and the third OldReckoning Cultures). Communist propaganda 
(the knowledge of the Alpha Complex version of Communism — its dictates, its Bracteristics, and its theories. A character might completely disagree with what these ctrines say, but knowledge of the skill is enough.
See, communist propaganda is infectious. Clones mainly use this skill to pass it along to ber clones. The BDN of passing along this skill is twice the target’s Chutzpah—modified (how obvious the player (or gamemaster character) is being about spouting doctrine. JAnd how does one spout Commie doctrine? Simple — think of all those “cartoon jmmies” you may have seen in old Fifties and Sixties and Eighties (?) movies — they all «with a funny accent, and they all spout catch-phrases like “Verkers ov the Vorld, Unite!” Id they tend to wear long, fake moustaches and big, furry caps with stars on them. [Doesn’t this get them executed a lot in Alpha Complex? Well, no, not really—not unless iy run into someone with communist propaganda who can recognize their attempts at aversion. And possession of the skill is grounds for execution, so anyone who can [cognize communist propaganda for what it is has a good chance of getting executed. Hie Computer and some of Its higher-level operatives have knowledge of communist tyaganda, of course, and can recognize it — indeed, a high level Troubleshooter could (obably be forgiven for one or two adds in the doctrine, as long as he isn’t spouting it off. Note: In stressful situations, characters with communist propaganda will often fall ito funny accents, pull out little red books they didn’t know they had, or put on funny hats td salute “the Glorious Proletariat.” They will speak treason against the Computer ithout knowing it, and get themselves into a world of trouble.
Whenever you feel like having this happen, it does. A good game mechanic is to have e hapless clone make a Tough communist propaganda skill check. If he succeeds, he outs doctrine or does something else incriminating — possibly infecting others. Inform Oplayer that he can’t stop himself, but has to do it. That should make him real popular tth the team.
r
Description: This is another player character skill. They’ll use it when they want to
t

Other- be, it is probably j ust an example of fast talk. Cons should be roleplayed out whenever psible, but a DN can be determined based on the target’s Chutzpah.
WTAIX*
Description: This skill is used to get out of immediate trouble or get to an immediate al. It is think-on-your-feet, bald-faced lying at its best. A player who can do this with traight face should be given huge modifiers for his success, while players who just can’t (m to keep up the banter won’t succeed no matter how well they roll. The Base DN, if utieed one, is usually the target’s Chutzpah.
WRY
Description: Alpha Complex thrives on paperwork. Unfortunately, much of it is mputer-processed, tongue-stamped, tissue-sample-attached and damn hard to forge. A t of what goes into the skill of forgery is making a document look official — making Bgue prints look like they’ve been taken, making authorizations look like they’ve been tale... basically, the character has to make the document look so “right” that no one runs [through a scanner or shows it to the Computer.
[The BDN of a forgery check is usually equal to the reader’s own skill in forgery or his putzpah skill.
тмобАгюл/*
Description: Players will want to get information out of their enemies before they kill em—at least smart players will. The BDN is usually the target’s Chutzpah, modified i or down by the situation. Trying to interrogate an armed Vulture Trooper while he’s Iding you by the throat is cause for a positive DN modifier, while holding that same ilture Trooper out over a vat of acid will usually get more desirable results.

want to end up on next daycycle's recycling menu, maybe he'd better cooperate.
MOT/YATfON*
Description: This skill is used in a manner similar to intimidation, except the idea is usually to inspire or excite gamemaster characters into action. The BDN could be the target's (or average targets') Chutzpah skill, but it is more likely to be determined from the apparent danger offollowing the Troubleshooter's lead. For example, trying to inspire a group of unarmed clones to leave their relatively safe hiding place behind a serving counter to leap out and attack a biochemical horror created from cafeteria food waste is probably going to be difficult at best. However, if the motivating clone is high clearance and is holding a large weapon on the cowardly citizens (or, even worse, a camcorder with a direct feed to the Computer's Loyalty Banks), the Base Difficulty Range will drop considerably.
ORATORY
Description: Motivation and intimidation are used in the heat of the moment. Oratory is for premeditated speeches. The effect is the same: a call to action.
Trying to explain to a crowd of normally loyal citizens why they should board and take control of Transtube 183 could be a use of oratory. Convincing a group of gamemaster character Troubleshooters that they should elect you Team Leader could also be oratory. The BDN is usually the target's (or average targets') Chutzpah, but should certainly be modified by the situation.
P£RC£PH(M
Description: Player characters use this to wade through the vat-sludge of others'
ramblings, and to spot lies or inconsistencies. Most likely, though, it will be used when you want to give the Troubleshooters a chance to detect a nasty surprise. For example, if the player characters have just walked into an ambush. Those who make their perception rolls (the BDN being the average sneak skill value of the Commies/Mutants/Traitors setting the ambush) are aware of the ambush and see the attack coming (a lot of good it will do them — but, hey, they can try to dodge). Those who fail are oblivious until the lasers start firing.
Gamemaster characters use the skill the same way. They also use it quite often to search player characters for contraband — in which case the BDN is usually determined by you according to how well you think the player character hid the stuff. Heh, heh, heh
SPUR/OUS IOG/C*
Description: This works best on the nonliving of Alpha Complex — bots and the Computer, mainly — but can be substituted for con or fast talk in a pinch. The player character tries to set up a chain of logic so convoluted and so involved that the hot or Computer brain just can't follow it. The BDR is determined by both your opinion of the intelligence level ofthe hot (the Computer is always a base of nearly impossible), and how important you think the bot thinks it is to unravel the logic.
For example, trying to convince a scrubot that, because of a series of seemingly logical events, you, a Red Troubleshooter, belong in this Indigo-clearance hallway is probably not all that hard — while the premise is probably very shaky, the scrubot's main concern is scrubbing the floors, walls, and any slow-moving clones, not security. Call it a normal check. However, trying the same argument on a doberbot security android is a lot less effective — it can devote all its processing power on figuring out your logic ... and then all its weaponry on killing you.
Not that you have to worry about that — you're the gamemaster. The players have to try convincing you.
Оехтеыту Smis
if/£RGY W£APONS
Description: This skill allows characters to use various forms of energy weapons, like plasma guns or sonic weapons. The BDN of shooting someone with an energy weapon is the target's Agility. This can be modified by surprise, range, cover, or whatever you think 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY.
is appropriate. Ifyou think a character should hit, he hits. Ifyou don't, he misses. That's the joy ofbeing absolute overlord ofyour domain.
Oh, the target can dodge a hit, after a hit is determined. But only ifyou say so.
Fmo IVEAPOA/S
Description: This skill lets characters use field weapons, such as howitzers or grenade launchers. The BDR is determined by the gamemaster, depending on range, the reliability of spotting information, and anything else you feel like throwing in. A field weapon hit can be dodged, but it is pretty unlikely (ever try to dodge a tacnuke blast?)
lASER WEAPOA/S
Description: Most clones in Alpha Complex know the basics ofhow to use a laser weapon, even if they never get one themselves. Laser pistols are the most common laser weapons, with laser rifles being more scarce. This is a very popular skill among Troubleshooters — "Keep your laser handy," and all that. The BDN to hit a target is that target's Agility, but a successful "hit" can be dodged.
MfSStLE WEAPOA/S
Description: Actually a seldom-selected skill, missile weapons covers the use of Old Reckoning gadgets like bows, slings, slingshots, and other obsolete weapons. Of course, getting impaled by a makeshift crossbow bolt and lasered through the chest is thought to have much the same effect on most clones. The BDN to hit a target is that target's Agility, but a successful "hit" can be dodged.
PROJECT/LE И/EAPOA/S
Description: Slugthrowers fit into this category, as do other weapons that hurl accelerated objects at a hapless target. Think Old Reckoning machineguns, .44s, and other nasty, small-entry-wound, large-exit-wound weapons. The BDN to hit a target is that target's Agility, but a successful "hit" can be dodged.
/6 WCIE IVEAPOA/S
Description: Tank guns and portable artillery fit into this category. It moves, it shoots, something explodes. Similar to field weapons (really, they're usually field
weapons mounted on vehicles), a successful use ofthis skill can be dodged. The BDN is A/OfV 7W7lS PRESSURE _ completely up to the gamemaster.
MecHWCAt SKUIS
HAB/TAT fA/G/A/EER/A/Gi
Description: This skill gives the character a working knowledge of the air, communica¬tions, transportation, power, water, and waste systems of Alpha Complex. The character has a chance to know where odd ventilation or sewage shafts might lead, or how to gum up a particular airflow corridor to get nasty traitors in a defen¬sive position to give themselves up.
JVRYRfGGfA/Gt
Description: This skill allows characters to use their Mechanical Aptitude to get broken things working or working things to do different things than they were supposed to. This can be a lot of fun for both players and gamemasters.
For example, the Troubleshooters somehow manage to sneak inside a secret society (let's say PURGE) hidy-hole. One of the characters uses his habitat engineering skill to determine where the vent fans and air ducts all are. But, 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
instead of shutting down the system, one bright Troubleshooter decides to break open the team's pharmecutical supplies and use jury rigging to set the air filtration system up as a dispenser. Ifhe succeeds, the entire PURGE cell will soon be sailing on Happy Pills and they can leap down and capture them with a minimum of fuss.
Човот OPS MO МАН/ПЫМСЯ
Description: This skill description actually covers several different types ofrobot ops:
Transbots: Transportation robots with large passenger/cargo compartments.
Docbots: Medical bots that care for the sick and injured of Alpha Complex.
Jackobots: All-purpose bots who do general labor or errands.
Scrubots: Janitor-bots that clean up the messes made by everyone else in Alpha Complex. Flybots: Transportation bots with the capability of flight.
Characters can use this skill to operate and maintain (or sabotage) the bots of Alpha Complex. The BDN for reprogramming should be determined and modified based on how complicated the character's orders or modifications are and how close they are to the bot's initial programming. As for maintenance, determine how damaged you think the bot is and start at a normal BDR for relatively minor damage.
Vewcie OPS MO MA/A/TMMCO
Description: This skill description covers the maintenance of all types of Alpha Complex vehicles, as well as their use:
Autocars: Clone-operated transports.
Vulturecraft: Armed Forces Vulture Warriors (armored flybots with weaponry)
Fliers: Clone-operated, civillian aircraft.
Characters actually use this skill directly to make dodge checks in vehicles they are piloting, as well as to drive around obstacles. When making a dodge check, the BDN is determined as for dodge, only using this skill. When maneuvering around obstacles, the BDR is determined solely by the gamemaster.
Moxte Sx/us
Вюсием THCRAPT
Description: The diagnosis and application of mental and physical enhancement drugs, usually provided by the Computer to insure cooperation and peak efficiency. A good Troubleshooter team always has enough pills to see it through a mission.
Use this skill when characters want to determine what drugs are what as well. Just
because you pushed a button marked "Pick 'Em Ups" doesn't mean you won't get a handful of depressants.
B/OSC/£A/C£Si
Description: Biology. Mostly the biology ofclones, but Troubleshooters with this skill might be able to figure out the workings of Outdoor creatures, as well has what they eat, how they eat, and will they eat me?
Снштяуъ
Description: Stick a bunch of Troubleshooters in a lab and they'll be blowing things up in no time. We could give you a whole formula for determining the BDR of chemistry attempts based on the effect of whatever the Troubleshooters are creating, but even the Computer's best clone chemists spend most of their time just throwing different liquids and solids together and trying to make pretty colors (or loud explosions). The bots and the Computer are the only ones with any real knowledge.
COMPUTER PROGRAMME?
Description: A really, really dangerous skill. Since the only computer in Alpha Complex is the Computer, this skill reflects the ability of a character to actually program the Computer in certain, very limited ways.
Unlike many other skills, computer programming is actual useful knowledge. A person who succeeds at a computer programming check can get the Computer doing just about anything he wants. Obviously, this means most BDRs should be prohibitively high.

Also, possession and knowledge of this skill is considered treason. That's right —just know¬ing this skill exists can get a Troubleshooter killed. This can be pretty scary, especially since everybody knows about High Programmers — who are the only clones for whom this skill is not treason—but nobody actually knows what they do (or should know what they do).
This skill can be taught to player characters by High Programmers, traitors, or other game- master-controlled characters (even the Computer might do it—how's that for a conflict ofinterest), but it cannot be learned in any other way.
DATA ANALYSIS^
Description: Oh, this is a really fun skill. If
the clones of Alpha Complex don't know how everything works, they really don't know how to learn. This skill is used to wade through reams and reams of print-cuts and screens and screens of computer files. Oh, and when we say com¬puter, we mean Computer — you're looking in the Big C's memory and access files for informa¬tion. Hope you got that authorization right.
Whenever the characters have access to Com¬puter information, they should make data analy¬sis rolls to understand it. Misinterpretation and confusion is the key to adventuring in Alpha Complex. Okay, one ofthe keys (or is that two?) But how does all this neat confusion and misin-terpretation start? Here's an example:
•	Way over in OUT sector, an area on the every edge of Alpha Complex, a crack in the main dome appears. It doesn't look serious, so one of the local HPD&MC officials decides not to handle it himself (it's high up there) and puts in a requisition for a maintenance bot. He fills out
the proper forms, reporting the crack and requisitioning the bot, and goes back to his nap.
•	The local Computer node analyzes the report and the request and shunts the report over to HPD&MC's record structure, while the request goes to PLC (they have the bots). The information, as yet, has not left the Computer, but is in the appropriate nodes.
• The HPD&MC node checks the report against OUT sector's maintenance files and Relative Resupply Report (RRR) and a red flag comes up: OUT sector has never had an RRR before, and has, therefore, never had any maintenance at all (never mind that OUT sector's titanium/plasticrete dome was constructed only a yearcycle ago and should perform without major maintenance for nearly a decade). The HPD&MC node contacts the IntSec and Armed Forces nodes, checking to see if there have been any reports of sabotage or armed assaults that could have caused this damage. Meanwhile, it sends an update to the PLC node, informing it of these developments.
• The PLC node has been processing the request for the maintenance bot. It seems that the exact model bot the HPD&MC clone requested is not in stock at the moment — all models of that type were sent to construct a new dome in DUI sector and came down with some sort of nasty program virus. The PLC node begins to send a response to OUT sector, asking if a substitute model will suffice.
But then PLC hears from the HPD&MC node and notices the red flag. It upgrades the priority on the request, past the possibility of a double-check. Since there was already a double-check in progress, however, it tags the file with another red flag, alerting all other nodes to the fact that there may be an emergency.
• At the same time, IntSec node receives the request for information on possible sabotage. It contacts its OUT-local nodes and scans for any reports or unusual happenings. The only thing it finds is the HPD&MC request for repairs and the report ofthe crack. However, 
IULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. ■■
there is no red flag on the request or the report — but there is an alert keyed to the one IntSec received. It is comparing the two reports when it receives the second red flag from PLC.
This sets off an alert in the IntSec node. Something's up. Two red flags in under a nanosecond (oh, the Computer works really fast) is probably big trouble. The IntSec node alerts its local OUT nodes of the two red flags and adds a third flag — a yellow "Investigation Underway/High Priority" tag — to the file.
• Meanwhile, Armed Forces is searching is records for any armed conflicts in OUT sector. No reports after the initial troop movement into the new sector; everything going smoothly. It sends back its report to the HPD&MC node.
• Because there is a yellow flag on OUT sector and this series of data specifically, however, IntSec is routed a copy ofthe response. It analyzes the Armed Forces "all clear" note and determines that, if there is any threat present in OUT sector, it must be covert—so covert that the Armed Forces cannot be trusted to deal with the threat. After all — they missed it until now. It upgrades its yellow flag to a black one: "Operatives Dispatched" and notifies its OUT sector node that IntSec agents in the sector are to be put on full alert and that they are to investigate everything, starting with the HPD&MC clone who reported ffAPPfMfSSfSAHfALTHYOOSf the crack in the dome. It notifies all other Service Group nodes that IntSec has an Of PffAAMACft/TfCAlS	investigation underway and that all information on OUT sector is to be routed directly to
IntSec node immediately.
•	This alarms HPD&MC and PLC — they were both ready to send in materials and a substitute repair bot, but they don't want to go into a "hot" sector without some sort ofback-up. They both file requests with the Armed Forces for escorts into OUT sector.
•	The Armed Forces node receives this request and revises its files on OUT sector, reporting to all nodes that there is military activity going on in the sector — in fact, there is a request for two sets offerees in the area. It responds to PLC and HPD&MC that it will supply two escorts — a Mark IV Warbot to guard PLC's maintenance bots (actually one small maintenance bot), and a squad of Vulture Troopers to escort the plasticrete supplies (actually fifty kilos of plasticrete mix).
•	IntSec, of course, receives this report as well and notifies its agent nodes that Armed Forces troops are on the move. Rather than risk IntSec involvement in an Armed Forces operation (the Computer knows the two Service Groups don't get along), the node decides to contact the Troubleshooter node and request a team with at least one IntSec agent be sent in to OUT sector.
•	This request is, of course, filled. A Trouble¬shooter Team will be sent to investigate Commie Mutant Sabotage in OUT sector. They are given the name and location ofthe clone who filed the report, but not information on the report itself or the crack — they are there to investigate general sabotage, and the HPD&MC clone is their only lead.
So, sometime in the near future, a bot, a fifty- kilo bag of plasticrete mix, an armed squad of Vulture Troopers, a Mark IV Warbot, and a Troubleshooter team will arrive in OUT sector. The sector itselfhas been put on alert by IntSec, and all local agents will be on the look-out for trouble. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. ..
But, in the meantime, a lone HPD&MC clone receives a verification ofhis report and request: "Report noted and filed. Request approved. Thank you for your cooperation. Have a nice daycycle." If only that clone had data analysis so he could read between the lines ...
DATA SEARCH
Description: Before you can analyze it, you have to find it. Characters can use this skill to wade through all kinds of Computer-speak to find what they need. Take the example above: if a clone on the Troubleshooter team were to try to find out why they have been sent to OUT sector, they'd not only have to wade through all that drivel, but more besides — and it would be in Computer-language. They'd have to roll to find the reason (the crack in the dome) amidst all the confusion. The more specific the search, the harder the check. The broader the search, the more useless information they find.
DiMOUTtOHS
Description: The skill is nasty. Clones have enough knowledge to destroy—that's for sure. And, now, they've got everything from microbombs to hand-held tacnukes to do it with.
Demolitions is used not only to blow up things, but to do it in an efficient manner. Anyone can trigger a fuse or pull a grenade pin, but can they blow down a door or crack a safe without blowing themselves and everything else nearby up?
Figure out the BDR based on your opinion of how difficult it is for the Troubleshooter to determine how strong the object they want to blow is. Add or subtract from this based on how tough the object really is, and how much explosive the Troubleshooter has access to. No matter how good a demolitions roll is, there is no way a Troubleshooter will blow a hole in a titanium-steel wall with a tiny firecracker. However, ifthe character is trying to blow a weak plasticrete door with a tacnuke grenade — and not damage everything else in the vicinity — that can be just as ridiculous.
BiECTROHtCS'
Description: Most everything in Alpha Complex runs on electricity. Messing around with wires and electrodes can really provide some surprising results. Let characters try to increase the efficiency of conductors with their own spit, and try to mess with those
FIRST A/D
Description: Characters get hurt in Paranoia — that's part ofthe fun. They can also try to fix each other. But, remember what I said about Alpha Complex clone knowledge —first aid can be more dangerous than the alternative.
The BDR of any first aid attempt is based on the number ofwounds the character has taken. Start at simple for one wound, increasing the BDR by one per additional wound taken. A successful first aid attempt'means that the target can ignore the effects of his wounds until properly healed or damaged again (at which time he goes back to his original state, plus any additional wounds).
That's right, folks; that means first aiding characters who can take lots of wounds (and do) is harder thanfirst aiding a wimpy character who can only take a few wounds. Ifyou want to be more realistic, you can allow for partial healing: a character has taken four wounds, meaning, his treatment BDR is Tough. A character with & first aid skill value of 10 gets ahold of him. The Check Number he needs to beat is between 10 and 12 — the gamemaster picks 10, because the clone is so tough. But the die roll turns up a nine. Too bad, so sad ... no healing.
But the gamemaster could, if he wishes, say that the clone loses the effects of three wound levels — if he had only been wounded three times, he'd be fixed now. It's only the fourth that is bothering him. This is a gamemaster call and, as always, up to you.
More information on wounds and healing can be found in Chapter Six, "Combat."
Mmnwtcs\
Description: This skill allows characters to take parts and tools and assemble them into strange contraptions. It is not the same as juryrigging, which assumes you are starting with a working or partially-working whole. As a result, most mechanical skill checks will have high BDRs, unless the mechanism being constructed is fairly simple. 
For example, a pully-run anvil-on-the-head trap would be pretty simple: normal difficulty. A trap that caused a targetting computer to lock onto a specific subject when that subject entered a monitored field of fire, and then caused all weapons to discharge at that target would be considerably more intricate: nearly impossible or ridiculous, in fact.
R/UCLEAR £A/G/A/EER/A/G\
Description: Ifthe player characters are using this skill, they are probably in trouble. Unlike most ofthe other "repair" skills, this will seldom be used (I hope) as a "breaking" skill. Nuclear reactors melt down, tacnukes explode. Messing up one ofthese rolls means either a radiation bath or a big exothermic reaction.
OLD RECKOMMG CULTURES^
Description: You know stuff about "the old days," before the Computer. Gee, take this skill and go tell everyone about it. Go ahead, we dare you.
SecuRrrv
Description: Troubleshooters can use this skill to get past, disable, or enable and use security systems like monitors, motion detectors, and microphones (not to mention tongueprint scanners and all those neat high-tech devices). The BDR is either determined by the gamemaster, or a BDN is determined by finding the security or surveillance skill of the clone or bot operating the security system.
SURVEftUWCE
Description: This skill ties in more with security than perception. The ability to read monitors and scan areas with remote mikes and cameras is surveillance. The BDN can be the sneak or security skill of an opponent, or a BDR can be determined by the gamemaster.
Swmmi
Description: It is treason to go Outdoors, so this skill is only useful in the "wilds" of Alpha Complex. On the back-transtubes of AC, in the strange simplexes, and in unfamiliar sectors, characters can use this skill to find much-needed information, supplies, and directions. The BDR is completely up to the gamemaster, but should be modified by any player inspirations that come up.
Огнев SR/U /HFORMAT/OH

Paranoia is supposed to be a fast-paced, fun-to-play, not-at-all-realistic game. The rules system in the previous chapter is intended to promote that — come up with an approximate difficulty, roll the dice, and beat a check number.
Combat's the same way. We aren't interested in exact movement or ranges or cover modifiers. Sure, if you want to throw that stuff in, you can, but Paranoia is about roleplaying, and combat is a big part of many roleplaying games, so we are looking for ways to make combat a roleplaying experience.
$P№D OF PlAV
Paranoia gamemasters need to keep the action moving. Make it fun, make it fast, and make it work ... any way you see fit. Sure, it's important to know when a character has been hit or killed in combat, but, since you are the gamemaster, you decide when that happens and when it doesn't. You can approximate and make things happen.
ROUPIAWMG RFAUSM
Sure, it may be more realistic to have miniatures or chits on a table and worry about distance, facing, movement rates, and all that other crap, but is it realistic to have players conferring over strategies, counting out movement, measuring distances, and optimizing their abilities?
In the speed real combat happens. Give me a break.
So, we sacrifice the "realism" of a tabletop battlefield for the roleplaying feel of "real" combat. Something's happening! Do something! Uh, oh—too late.
Dout Gm Ткем Т/ме то Ткмк!
When Troubleshooters are wandering around Alpha Complex, looking at things and playing their little mind games on each other, you can describe things in great detail — and you should. As the gamemaster, you want to paint an interesting picture ofthe world.
But, when the Troubleshooters find themselves in a combat situation, they won't have time to count the tiles on a wall or check out all the neat diodes and buttons on their communicators—they'll have to react.. .fast! Give them the basics and make them guess:
Gamemaster: Okay. You pry open the hatchway and begin to look inside. Suddenly, a laser blast glances offthe door frame! Someone's attacking! What do you do?
Ifthey want to think about it, or confer, or debate, or look around, then they are going to miss rounds of combat. What is a round of combat you may ask? A round of combat is when somebody does something — usually lots of somebodies. Sometimes, clones will want to do things that take longer than other clones. Fine, they are doing things for lots of combat rounds. Hope they don't get shot in the head. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. ..
KEEP fr PARAMOfA
When an attack comes from one direction, the Troubleshooters should still be reminded that trouble can come from all others — even within their own party. When a Troubleshooter does have the opportunity to look around, warn them of imagined dangers and possible treason.
Gamemaster: Roy-G, you pull your laser and start shooting at any available targets through the hatchway. You see a hot with a laser mount firing in your direction, so you blast it. (Roy-G rolls dice and gamemaster determines the result.) As you are firing, you think you notice something moving off to your right, and you also are aware ofyour teammates. All of them are behind you. Anyone else doing anything?
Too often, Troubleshooters forget about backstabbing each other in the heat of combat. You can remind them.
REWARD ROLEPLAVWG AA/D 0ERR/MG-0O/
When somebody tries something wacky or different, rather than obviously "safe" or "intelligent," reward them. Oh, sure, you may kill them as well, but make them feelgood about trying whatever it is they want to do.
Player: Okay, as his next action, Roy-G decides to dive through the hatchway and past the laserbot. I'm still blazing away at it, but I want to come up with it between me and the hatch¬way, and I want to be facing the right.
Gamemaster: (Hasplayer roll dice) Right. You dive through the hatch toward the laserbot. This triggers its mutli-fire option and it starts raking the area with multiple bursts of red light. (Rolls dice, ignores result) But, miraculously, all these bursts miss you. Unfortunately foryour hesitant companions, they all get hit for (Rolls dice again) ... ooh, time to activate new clones.
Off to the right, you see another laserbot moving toward you. It draws a bead and ... (Rolls dice again, winces in mock sympathy) Well, at least it blew up the other laserbot as well ...
Kfu Ткем, Kfu THEM ALL/
In other roleplaying games, you don't usually want to dispatch characters with any degree of frequency, or the players get annoyed and start looking for a new gamemaster. They put a lot oftime into developing their characters, and they want to get some use out of them.
In Paranoia, the opposite is supposed to be true. Character creation is quick and easy, and, besides, everyone gets six clones—they'll get a good session or two (or maybe more) out of their Troubleshooter, and then it's probably time for a new one.
A MODEST EXAMPLE
In Paranoia, Second Edition, there was a good example of how combat should go. It carries over to this edition with very little modification:
GM: Right. You walk the narrow, V-shaped corridor area. Natives would call it a gulley, but you don't know any better, here in the Outdoors. The sides ... excuse me, walls are irregular and dark-colored, and there's heavy, brown lumpy stuff falling off them into puddles of water. The floor is squishy and whatever paint they used keeps coming off on your feet. Suddenly, from above you and to the left, there comes a strange, ululating sound. Fred — what do you do?
Fred: Urn ... what's "ululating?"
GM: Hooting and wailing. What do you do?
Fred: Well ... (Long, thoughtful pause)
GM: Right-o. And you, Martha?
Martha: I try to identify the sound and where it is coming from.
GM: George?
George: I get my laser ready and I dive behind a rock ...
GM: Ahem ...
George: Eh? Oh, yeah ... I dive behind a gray thing and prepare to blast tilings.
GM: That's better. Okay, George is behind the brown thing, Martha is looking around — it sounds like humans to you, Martha, but they are yelling something like "Ooga-booga!" Fred, you stand thoughtfully. Six naked guys with bad hygiene and pointy things in their hands come zooming over the slope and dash down at you. Fred ...?
Gamemaster Note: See how the GM waited until everyone had declared what they were doing to give any results? You don't have to do this — especially when you are 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
running for a large group — but it keeps players from using information other players supposedly found out at the same time.
Fred: What do these guys look like?
GM: Right. Martha?
Martha: I yank out a grenade, lob it at them, and duck for cover.
GM: George?
George: I cover Martha.
GM: Fine. Fred, they look like insane naked citizens with poor hygiene and pointy things. They're hair is matted and the pointy things look like weapons. They're yelling and gesturing unpleasantly ... at you, by the way. One sticks a spear ... excuse me, pointy thing at your chest.
Martha, roll the die (Clatter) Oooh, that looks bad. Pity.
The grenade misses, bounces off the wall, and rolls back down the hill back where you were standing. Right beside Fred, in fact.
George, you see one of the citizens throwing a spear at Martha, so you zap him. Roll the die. Whoa! Good shot! Bull- bot's eye! Roll damage ... Great, he drops. Fred?
Fred: Say, this is going too ...
GM: Okay ... Martha?
Martha: (Snickers) Fred is obviously a Commie traitor.
Look, he's talking to those filthy mutants! I shoot him, then run for cover.
GM: Right-o. George?
George: I zap another Ooga-Booga mutant.
Fred: Say, you guys ...
GM: Fine. Okay, the grenade explodes. (GM rolls damage)
Several O-B's bite the dust... err, mud and, Fred, it looks like you take some damage, too. You survive. (Fred sighs with relief, but the GM continues) But so does the mutant with the
pointy thing. He stabs you in the chest before he keels over from his wounds. Martha then shoots you in the head. (Bounces die) Smell of charred Fred permeates the corridor.
Okay, to sum up. Fred is charred, stabbed, and partially blown up. George misses the other Ooga-Booga, but it doesn't seem to matter — he runs. Martha, you make it to the brown things and crouch behind them, just like George.
Fred: Heh, heh. I get it. When does my next clone show up?
GM: Soon, Fred. Your friend the Computer will get right on it, just as soon as George and Martha make their reports. Back to the action.
Okay, the ground shudders and the remaining Ooga-Boogas go crazy. They run or collapse, shaking. A giant, glistening black hot with a head the size of a transbot terminal — with huge, compound sensors and long antennae — appears above the corridor and peers down.
George: (Whispers) Oh, swell. Giant radioactive mutant cockroaches again ...
Martha: Black? Infrared clearance, obviously. I order it to pick us up and return us to Alpha Complex immediately.
GM: Err ... good idea. It reaches down with its mandibles ... oops ... its cargo grapplers and
Gamemaster Note, Too: See how the GM never let up on Fred, but he didn't really embarrass him or pick on him either. He didn't start going around the table a different way to give "the new guy" a chance to think about what he wanted to do, but he also made it clear that Fred would soon be back in the fun.
COMBAT SeQi/ivcwG
Each combat round is supposed to last about five seconds. Obviously, from the above example, this isn't always true. It's up to you how long each round lasts. But there is a combat sequence you will probably want to follow.
GAMMASr£R /VTRODUCT/OV PHAS£
The gamemaster introduces the combat. Generally, this only happens during the first round of combat, and is a quick summation of what happens.
GM: Right. You walk the narrow, V-shaped corridor area. Natives would call it a gulley, but
you don't know any better, here in the Outdoors. The sides ... excuse me, walls are irregular and 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
dark-colored, and there's heavy, brown lumpy stuff falling off them into puddles ofwater. The floor is squishy and whatever paint they used keeps coming off on your feet. Suddenly, from above you and to the left, there comes a strange, ululating sound. Fred — what do you do? , That's a quick introduction. It gives some details, but holds the rest back. After all, the players weren't ready for combat, were they?
PCATER CHARACTER OEC/S/ON SEGMENT
Now the players decide what they are going to do, and they say it as quickly as they can. Generally, the gamemaster should give them five seconds or so (each) to get it out — if they can't say it that fast, they can't do it.
Fred: Well ... (Long, thoughtful pause)
Not a good example of a decision, but a decision nonetheless. Fred spends his five seconds thinking, so that's what his character is doing. On the other hand:
George: I get my laser ready and I dive behind a rock ...
That's a much more intelligent response.
GAMEMASTER CHARACTER OEC/S/ON SEGMENT
Most likely, the gamemaster will have decided what the gamemaster characters are going to do long beforehand. However, since he is the gamemaster, he has the privilege of changing his mind when he wants to.
We do not encourage this. Ifa player does a really smart thing that catches you off-guard, it should catch your characters off-guard as well. However, your decision segment is placed here so that you can change your mind when it really seems to be the most fun idea possible.
You do not have to announce your decisions—normally, you save that for the " Combat Resolution Segment."
COMBAT RESOLUT/ON SEGMENT
At this point, all actions are resolved. Presumably, everything happens simulta¬neously, but that's only ifyou say so. In the above example, George was able to zap an "Ooga Booga" before he could stick Martha, but an Ooga Booga killed by Martha's grenade still got to stick Fred.
It's a good idea to have all die rolls and actions resolved at the same time. That makes sure that nobody benefits from an action performed during the same round by another character unless you think it is appropriate.
GM: That's better. Okay, George is behind the brown thing, Martha is looking around — it sounds like humans to you, Martha, but they are yelling something like "Ooga-booga!" Fred, you stand thoughtfully. Six naked guys with bad hygiene and pointy things in their hands come zooming over the slope and dash down at you. Fred ...?
Notice how the end of one round of combat leads right into another.
O/e Rous, MOD/E/EAS, 0/mei/av NUMBERS, AMO Au TRAT JAZZ
Okay, so we've told you how it's supposed to go; here's the game mechanics.
When in combat, Troubleshooters will want to do things like hit, kick, shoot, and explode their friends and enemies. Presumably, your characters want to do the same to them. Here's how.
Wout/ci, ETC,
All combat skills are covered in Chapter Five, "Skills (Mark ID" under Agility and Dexterity skills. However, for a quick summation, here's how they work.
There are two types of violence in Paranoia-.ranged violence and melee violence. Ranged violence occurs when you are trying to shoot or throw something at a target. Melee violence happens when you try to get up-close and personal with a target (a kick, punch, stab, etc.).
RANGED ATTACKS
When you use a ranged weapon to attack someone, use the skill description in Chapter 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
Five, "Skills (Mark II)") to determine difficulty levels. Usually, when you are attacking another character, you use that character's Agility as the DN.
Dodge: Ifyou hit someone with a ranged attack, and they were aware it was coming,
they can try to dodge. The difficulty level of a dodge can be determined from guidelines in the dodge skill description. If a character successfully dodges, then he was never actually hit.
MELEE ATTACKS
Hitting someone with your fists, a bludgeon, or a melee-type weapon is a melee attack. You have to be within a few meters ofsomeone to launch a melee attack, so ifa player tries to melee attack someone a block away, you can step in and disallow it.
The difficulty number of a melee attack is usually the target's Agility (see Chapter Five, "Skills (Mark II)"). You can't dodge a melee attack.
Smc, Off AMD OffffCULTY MOOffffRS
Gamemasters are encouraged to apply and award modifiers and bonuses whenever the situation warrants it. Even though Paranoia's combat system is supposed to be quick and easy, and there are no really "set in plasticrete" rules for modifiers, there are some guidelines you can use.
Poffi/Т-Вш/К RAA/GE
If a character is using a missile-type weapon (thrown weapon, laser pistol, slugthrower, etc.), and is standing within a few meters ofhis target (usually under three meters), you can choose to allow the player to add four to his die roll when he makes his check.
LONG RAA/GE
If a character is using a missile-type weapon and is, in your opinion, fairly far away from his target (this varies by weapon; thrown weapons have shorter long ranges than slugthrowers and lasers), then have the player subtract four from his die roll. Long range is usually in play when the target looks small enough that individual features are blurred (100 meters or so for lasers and slugthrowers) or a thrown or missile attack would take more than a couple seconds to reach the target.
WOMDEO ATTACKERS
For every wound a character takes, he is at -2 to all actions (see below). This includes attack rolls.
OTHER MOD/F/ERS
Hey, go wild. Ifyou want to start adding in cover modifiers, angle vectors, and other stuff, do so. Just remember: as the Paranoia gamemaster, you have a responsibility to be inconsistent and arbitrary at all times. Surprise 'em by seeming fair when it really isn't important.
Ш pRl/fTS Of WOUNCf
... i.e., "Damage."
Every weapon has a damage value. A damage value is the amount of damage a weapon does to a target. In the "Equipment" chapter, weapons are listed with their damage values. Modifying that damage value — to account for luck, skill, or situation — is resolved the same for every weapon.
Note: Hand-to-hand weapons (like knives or bludgeons) have damage values listed as plus numbers (+1, +2, +3 ... etc.). These pluses are added to the HTH Damage normally
done by an unarmed character (see below).
MoofFYwe THE DAMAGE (/AU/E
To modify the damage value of a weapon, simply roll 1d10 and add it to the damage value of a weapon. Characters have damage values equal to their HTH Damage (see Chapter Three, "Character Creation" in the Players' Section). So, a Troubleshooter with a HTH Damage of 5 (a Strength of 10) does 5+1d10 when he hits someone with his fist.
9? 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
APPLVWG THE DAMAGE VALUE
The damage of any attack is measured against the target's Macho (see Chapter Three, "Character Creation"). Subtract the target's Macho Stat from the attack's Modified- Damage Value, and you have the Damage Done.
REAO/HG me DAMAGE DOME
Then, take a look at the chart below. The higher the Damage Done, the more it affects a target character.
The effects are described below:
None: The blow was weak and has no effect.
Stunned: The character is stunned by the force of the blow and cannot act during his next action. Then he returns to normal.
Wounded: The character takes one wound. For every wound the character takes, he is at -2 to all skill rolls. If the character takes a number ofwounds equal to his Wound Levels (see Chapter Three, "Character Creation"), he goes unconscious. If he takes one or more wounds after that, he dies.
Wounded, Unconscious: The character takes a wound (as above) and is rendered unconscious. He remains unconscious for one minute or until successfully first aided or until the gamemaster says he wakes up.
Killed: Sorry, you're dead. Rack up the next clone.
Naturally, wounds and "killed" results can be interpreted any way the gamemaster sees fit. Arms and legs might be cut or blown off, or the damage might be more nebulous. Have fun, be grotesque.
HEAL/MG DAMAGE
Troubleshooters heal damage at any rate you want. One wound per daycycle is standard, but a docbot or healing drug can get clones up and running in no time.
ARMOR
Oh, if you have armor, that can protect you from certain attacks. Hand-to-hand attacks usually do bludgeoning (B) damage. Ifyou have armor that protects against bludgeoning damage (it will have a "B" on it by its description), then you add whatever follows the "B" ■ (the armor value) to your Macho Stat.	j
Other than bludgeoning attacks, there are laser (L), energy (E), and projectile (P) attacks. Each attack completely ignores armor that doesn't protect versus it. However, there is armor designated as ALL. That armor protects against everything.	,
i
LASERS AA/O REFLEC
And, just to make things more interesting, there are different types of lasers and ] different types of relec armor out there. Lasers come in different security clearances. Actually, the lasers are the same — it's the ammo that's different.
Each security clearance (except Infrared) has its own laser ammo. Reflec armor only protects against laser weapons of its security clearance or lower. Why does this work? Beats me — I'm not a physicist.
So, if a character is wearing Blue Reflec (L4), he can add the four points of armor value to his Macho when he is attacked by a laser weapon firing Red, Orange. Yellow, Green, or Blue laser bolts. Indigo, Violet, and Ultraviolet lasers go right through it.
A few VUCKY EXAMPUS
Here are some examples ofhow damage works.
HAMO-TO-HANO
Bruise-R and Wimp-Y are having a "discussion." It seems that Wimp-Y cut in front of ' Bruise-R in line and Bruise-R is objecting. Wimp-Y is of higher clearance, but there are no cameras or security agents in sight. Bruise-R takes a swing at Wimp-Y. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. .. 
Bruise-R wakes up quickly, however, and pulls a laser pistol ofhis own. He has Wimp- Ts unprotected back, so the gamemaster gives him +6 to hit (+4 for point-blank range and
another +2 for surprise). That's good, because he only has a laser weapons skill value of
2.
Wimp-Y has an Agility of 6 but, because he is not aware ofthe attack, the gamemaster decides to use a flat DN that he picks. He figures Bruise-R is still a little shaky and really, really mad, so he picks a Normal difficulty range (which is ac¬tually better for Wimp-Y — a 6 Agility is only at the top of Easy) and tells Bruise-R to roll.
Bruise-R rolls a 9 on the die, but gets +6 in modifiers for a die total of 15. Hmmn.
That's just barely a Normal success. The gamemaster says he hit, but tells him to subtract one from his damage value, since he "just grazed him." Wimp-Y can¬not dodge, since he was surprised.
Bruise-R rolls a d10 to add to the damage value of 8. He gets a 7, making the total a 15. But Wimp-Y has Yellow Reflec (L4), which protects against the Red bolt, so his modified Macho is 2+4=6. Fifteen minus six equal nine, so Wimp-Y takes another wound. One more wound, and he's unconscious.
Стг/л/е AND trs Bit/ms
Obviously, the combat sys¬tem is starting to look a little more drawn-out than in the
COMBAT 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
example. That's true — characters can take
several wounds before dying, and it's hard to kill someone, especially in armor, with one shot. So what can you do?
•	Modifiy Damage. Characters who get sur¬prised or shot at point-blank or who don't seem to be paying attention can take more damage than those who aren't. Simply use your head. Weapons are dangerous toys. No matter what the Damage Done says, ifyou think a character is dead, he's dead. Cheat in the players' favor fairly often (it will make things go faster and will be easier to keep track of), but cheat for yourself as well.
•	Reward Creativity. I keep saying this. If someone is really thinking and roleplaying well, and the only reason they don't take out their foe
with one shot is a bad die roll or a weak weapon, then bump it up a couple notches. Likewise, if the only reason someone seems to succeed is a tough weapon or through luck, cheat the other way.
•	Be Cinematic. Don't just say "you take a wound" — be colorful. "The laser catches you in the shoulder and you go spinning around, fall¬ing to the ground. You take one wound, but it feels like your arm is on fire!"
•	Introduce Optional Rules. You want hit locations? Make 'em up. Make up different ef¬fects. "You take one wound to the ... clatter of dice ... ow! The head! Well, that means you're unconscious, even though you can still take four more wounds!"
Above all, make it fun.
ClOA/e R$PIAC£M£MT
Of course, with this combat system and per¬mission for you to eradicate clones left and right, you're going to want to know how T rouble- shooters (and other clones) get replaced.
When a Troubleshooter dies, gauge, as a gamemaster, how important it is to your story to get the clone back in a timely manner — and how much it will disrupt the party ifthey have to wait. At the very least, you should always wait until the end ofthe current combat/encounter to bring the clone back — he died, so he doesn't get to finish the fight, the argument, or the experiment. Of course, if everybody dies, then you bring them back however you want.
Also, figure out how long it might take for a clone to reach the party from the Computer's Clone Banks and Replacement Center. Where is the CBRC? Well, that's up to you.
If Troubleshooters are in "downtown" Alpha Complex (any average sector), then clone replacement is usually quick — unless things get tied up in the bureaucracy. Generally, unless it is funny otherwise, the clone replacement shows up pretty soon.
In "outlying" sectors (older, more run-down areas especially) or in seldom-travelled areas (like underneath the food vats), clones might take a little longer to arrive. Maybe the player has to sit out an encounter or short scene before the replacement arrives.
When the Troubleshooters are in enemy territory (like a hostile simplex or Outdoors), clone replacement is usually by flybot or covert operations and can take hour- or daycycles. Sometimes, the Computer will even assign two clones from the same family (one played by the player, one by the gamemaster until the first dies) to such missions. Things get confusing fast. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
WH£R£ 00 R£PLAC£MBt/TS COMB FROM?
Some replacements are grown straight from the vat and their memories are MemoMaxed into them just as they are shipped out. These clones are usually indistinguishable from their previous clone brothers, unless there was some problem with transfer.
However, other replacements have been around for yearcycles, working at the CBRC at menial and very dull jobs, just waiting for their chance to "show their stuff" to the Computer. Now, they will be enthusiastic replacements for their clone brothers—but not necessarily the same.
OtMMB WAT SttBBT/
As the gamemaster, you should immediately take the gamemaster sheet of any Troubleshooter who gets wasted. Then you can make any changes you want at your leisure, before handing back the sheet, clone number marked down, to the player.
Stuff you can mess around with includes everything on the sheet. Heck, you can change the clone's name ifyou want. However, for ease of game play, we recommend only messing around with one or two things at most. Here are some suggestions.
$KfUS
Check out the skills the character has. Would you like anything to be different? If so, make it so. The clone has a 15 in laser weapons — no, no, no ... that part ofthe MemoMax didn't take. He has a 15 in habitat engineering instead. Or maybe you decide to add four ranks to the skill communist propaganda—the clones the replacement hung around with at the CBRC were his comrades, all right.
As a general rule, try not to take something away without giving something in return.
fim/Btsres
It is less likely that these will be changed, but they might be ... jumbled up. For example, Bruise-R might suddenly find his Moxie at 10, while his Strength is a 2. Wouldn't
that be strange?
Ifyou do change an attribute (or attributes), you may want to change them back after the following clone is eradicated.

While replacement clones can start with all the equipment they had before, some things might get lost, destroyed, or "appropriated" when they go down. Remember, they are still responsible for any equipment they are assigned—but the Computer is less likely to be hard on them if they can prove it was destroyed with them (they did their best to protect it).
Ofcourse, the Computer might send replacement clones out with new equipment. This is a great way to get adventure or scene-specific gear into an adventure after it has begun, and you can mess up an otherwise orderly group by sending a replacement clone in with tew R&D stuff.

Clones who die heroically might be brevetted up a level or two (temporarily — permanent promotions come at the end of the adventure), while treasonous deceased Troubleshooters can be demoted. It's up to you.
SECRET Soc/erv
Most ofthe time, the clone's secret society remains the same. However, you can roll for new one ifyou want—maybe this clone brother or sister made some contacts in CBRC. Of course, the original society will still expect its missions performed — it thinks the character is still a member.
MUTWT POWERS
Mutant powers seldom change. However, the strain of replacement might cause a character to forget he has a mutant power or activate a latent one. And there's no telling what CBRC is" sticking in their clone-growth vats ... maybe a new power roll would be
appropriate.

The player should usually play the character the same way, but the gamemaster might request a few different traits —just for fun. Usually, the player will be more cautious or more crazy — depending on how he takes being closer to the end of his six-pack — so asking for personality changes is a little extreme.

Of course, you should cross offthe dead clone's number and circle the new one. Unless, of course, there is a screw-up. Maybe clone #4 thinks he is clone #3 — or clone #5 ... or maybe he actually is (someone else screwed up).

In the Players' Section, we told them that some clones in Alpha Complex belong to secret societies — secret organizations that conspire to enact their own agendas within the confines of Alpha Complex. In the beginning ofthe Gamemaster Section, we told you that everybody belongs to a secret society, whether they know it or not.
You see, citizens of Alpha Complex have no private lives. Their entire existence is devoted toward serving the Computer and prolonging their inevitable execution for some real or imagined treason as long as possible.
But they have an outlet. In a society where "Trust No One" is the most important credo, small pockets of trust develop. Oh, sure, the trust between secret society members is no where near a sure thing — most would betray each other out of reflex, regardless of affiliation — but it is more than any other clone has for any other.
And the bonds are strengthening as the Computer gets more and more oppressive and totalitarian.
The Computer, however, knows ofthe existence of secret societies — It may even think that most citizens of Alpha Complex belong to one secret society or another (It certainly does not suspect that all clones belong to secret societies). It has decreed that membership in, or knowledge of, secret societies is treason, and uses Its Internal Security and Troubleshooter agents to stamp out this infestation whenever possible.
But It never quite goes all the way.
Perhaps the Computer realizes that most of the secret societies — or secret society members — in Alpha Complex are fairly harmless. Sure, they may talk a good game in their secret meeting places behind the food vats or in creches with temporarily-disabled vidmonitors, but most never do anything. Perhaps the Computer also realizes that clones need an outlet for their frustrations and secret societies are preferable to open rebellion.
Or maybe the Computer is biding Its time.
Rememberthat highly-placed agents ofa secret society may be ofhigh clearance within the Computer's organizations as well. If everyone in Alpha is a member of a secret society, then that means the High Programmers are, too. And they enter in Computer-programs so, while they do not control the Computer, they do have some input.
This might explain why the Computer is somewhat schizo—there are dozens of secret societies in Alpha Complex (not all are listed here), and ifthey all have at least one High Programmer (nobody knows how many HPs there are, but it's probably more than a few dozen) inputting conflicting information, things can get pretty weird.
$жет Soc/ету GeM£RAUZATtOHJS AMD RUMORS
Rumors are the work of secret societies and are, therefore, treason. But here are some rumors that many clones have heard about secret societies:

Tke OR/GW OF SFCRFT Soc/er/es
The true origin of secret societies can be traced back to the days ofthe Old Reckoning, when the Survivors built Alpha Complex in secret. However, the origin of the modern secret society is different.
You see, the Computer knows how powerful a secret organization can grow if not pruned every so often — that's how It came to be, after all. It did everything It could, initially, to stop secret society development in Alpha Complex.
It kept them out for nearly a year.
But then, a High Programmer (who will remain nameless), saw the conspiratorial and rebellious elements of Alpha Complex's population begin to seethe and grow. No matter how many times clones where refined and developed and controlled, the "negative" side of human nature — independent thought, desire, and greed — kept creeping in. The High Programmer started the first secret society (some say it was the Assemblers, others actually believe it was Death Leopards) as a "harmless outlet" for these characteristics, and began recruiting members.
But then other High Programmers caught on. Thinking that the first HP was brokering his own power base, they began to start their own groups. Then somebody had the bright idea to let the Computer in on the plan — maybe it was a tip-off, maybe it was tampering with the Computer's basic functions. Either way, it ended up really messing the Computer's priorities around. Where things had been totalitarian and orderly before, contradictions began to develop. The Computer was the absolute dictator of Alpha Complex, but It began to contradict Itself, rationalizing conflicts with the skill ofa human being. When the High Programmers realized what they had done, they tried to shut down parts of the Computer for repair, and It responded the only way It decided it could.
It obliterated them. Them, and much of Alpha Complex.

Oh, there are still shells of corridors out there, populated by hideous mutations and creatures from Outdoors, but the Computer did a marvellous job of blowing the vat out of anyone It thought was trying to shut It down.
For a while, it looked like the Computer Itselfhad crashed, but that was only another rumor. The Computer came back, stronger than ever, and began Its eternal war on Commies, traitors, mutants — many ofwhom were caused by Its initial strike, more who were caused by Its now-confused clone bank programs — and, of course, secret society members. Since that dark daycycle, the Computer has blamed secret societies for Its problems, and the secret societies have responded in their own ways.
But the Computer learned Its lesson: It first attempts to infiltrate and learn about secret societies. If It finds the society harmless, It will allow it to survive, only obliterating the society's most radical or obvious members. If the Computer deems a society danger¬ous, It will do Its best to kill off all known members and anyone with information on that society.
THE SECRET SOC/ETY CATALOGUE
The following is a listing ofmany secret societies of Alpha Complex. It is by no means an exhaustive list — and much ofthe information compiled here may be partially in error or completely false. Some ofthe secret societies listed here may have already been wiped out, and there are probably many more waiting in the wings.
THE SECRET SOC/ETY МАМЕ
Every secret society has a designation. Most were created by the first members, a few were created by the Computer or by those who first encountered the secret society. Either way, the designation has stuck, and that's what the society is known as. A few have nicknames, which will be noted in the description. The name is also followed by the secret society logo, which every clone in the society will know — most leave their logos lying around after a particularly daring act against their foes (like a Death Leopard putting an electromagnet in PLC's menu files, causing the local Infrared cafeteria to serve radioac¬tive waste to its customers and the nearest reactor to dump Bouncy Bubble Beverage onto its control rods).
DESCR/PT/OH
This description sums up the basics of the secret society. It is definitely an outsider's view — a member of the secret society would probably tell you something completely different about his or her group ... if you could get the clone to talk about it at all.
BEL/EFS
The basic tenets of the secret society, with motivations and a few characteristics.
H/ERARCHV
A general summation of the society's rank structure, along with known designations and perks.
ADVANCEMENT
How to acquire rank in the secret society.
BENN/ES
Some secret societies give clones automatic benefits for joining. Sometimes it is extra training in skills, other times the bennies are more nebulous. Any Troubleshooter who joins a secret society gains these bennies immediately.
SLAPS
Because ofthe nature ofthe secret society, clones may acquire some negativesjust for j oining—which attach themselves to T roubleshooters immediately upon their j oining the secret society.

Any allies or buddies the secret society has. Usually not as dependable as other members of the secret society, clones can still call on favors and expect assistance from
' secret society friends.
in/mtes
The antithesis ofthe secret society. It may be a philosophical difference, or it mightjust be a competition for territory or resources—the secret society really doesn't get along with these secret societies, who probably feel the same.
fiVThMVTAAtf
Description: Anti-Mutants hate mutants, all forms of muta¬tion, and all causes of mutation (though they love the Computer, who actually caused all mutations, because It is trying to stamp out mutations Itself). The obvious irony of being an Anti-Mutant member is the self-disgust that probably goes along with it—most Anti-Mutants know they have mutant powers, and blame others for their plight. Their only nickname is "A-M" — which they state is a "wakeup call for Alpha Complex."
Beliefs: Stamp out mutant powers. Kill mutants or, ifpossible, remove the cause for their mutant powers. Mutants want to supplant normal clones in the favor of the Computer and, though It resists their influence now, it is only a matter of time. Mutants can be in your head, in your heart, in your bathroom at any time! The only good mutant is a dead mutant — preferably a dead, vaporized, and recycled mutant! They want to control your mind! Registered mutants are the worst, because they have somehow convinced the Computer that we should not execute them—we must show the Computer they are all traitors and wipe them out to the last... ugh ... clone.
Hierarchy: Most Anti-Mutants are Sentinels, and they try to spy out any possible mutant activity they can find. Then, they inform their Controllers, who will dispach squads ofRedeemers to deal with the problem. Controllers and Redeemers are ranked alongside each other — a Controller-2 outranks a Redeemer-1, but Redeemer-2 is ofthe same rank. There are rumored to be 10 ranks of Controllers and 9 ranks ofRedeemers, though.
Advancement: Sentinels who spot lots of mutant activity and report it promptly can get promoted to Redeemer or Controller. Controllers are usually noncombat-oriented clones with access to communications, while Redeemers are strike team members. Promotion in the "officer" ranks is success-oriented. The greater the success, the greater the promotion.
Bennnies: Anti-Mutant Sentinels, Controllers, and Redeemers will assistjust about any clone who can prove he or she is acting against mutants in Alpha Complex — with support personnel, weapons, and equipment as necessary. The bigger the mutant threat, the more useful the assistance. Bennies can also include help in framing registered mutants for treason after-the-fact.
Slaps: Anti-Mutant Troubleshooters will seldom use their mutant powers ifthey can help it and, when they do, all difficulty numbers are increased by +3, or all difficulty levels by one. In addition, an Anti-Mutant who evidences a mutant power and is caught by another Anti-Mutant will either be targeted for execution or drummed out ofthe secret society. A-Ms will also go out of their way to give registered mutants a hard time, if not shoot them outright and bear the consequences later.

A Typical Anti-Mutant Conversation:
Anti-Mutant: Excuse me, can you tell me what time it is?
Citizen: (havingjust looked at his watch) Hmmn? Oh, yeah. It's about nooncycle.
A-M: You didn't look at your watch!
Citizen: Uh, right. I already knew —
A-M: You knew ?! Why, you must be a mutant with strange, temporal powers!
Citizen: Huh? Listen, I don't have time for —
A-M: Don't use your time powers on me! ZAPZAPZAPZAPZAP!

Perhaps this organization is why the Computer is so hard on Commies: they actually pose a threat to Its power. As a result, more clonesjoin the Commies every daycycle, and more clones are executed for being found out as Commies than all the other secret societies combined.
Beliefs: The Computer is a totalitarian oppressor of the workers! The workers of Alpha Complex should unite and throw off the shackles of the oppressor! The Computer's totalitarian capitalism is an opiate of the masses, and must be exposed for the virulent plague to the hum an spirit that it is! Someone should explain what all this dogma actually
means!
Hierarchy: Commies in cells are Workers. They think of all other clones in Alpha Complex as Workers, too, but they do distinguish between the "informed" and the "uninformed." They also believe that some clones are not just brainwashed by the Computer, but are fascist totalitarian capitalists as well.
Every group of Workers is led by a Cell Organizer. He is usually the most devoted Commie (the one with the highest ranks in the communist propaganda skill), but sometimes he is the best fast talker or con artist. Cell Organizers report to Bureau Members who, supposedly, report to a Bureau Chief and then the Cabinet Members. Finally, there is supposed to be a Kremlink, who is the link between Alpha Complex Commies and the Alpha State Communist Computer.
Advancement: It is very hard to advance in a Commie Cell. Most Workers stay Workers for life, unless they learn as much as they can about communist propaganda and are able to perform glorious missions in the name of the society. Unfortunately, Cell Organizers are on the lookout for ambitious Commies, and will often move to get them transferred or eliminated before they get too "uppity." This goes all the way up the ladder, with the Kremlink usually being the most vicious bastard in the Party, making sure nobody climbs to his level.
Bennies: All Commies gain one rank in communist propaganda. They also know people who know people who know how to get to Alpha State in an emergency.
Slaps: All Commies gain one rank in communist propaganda. They also know people who know people who know how to get to Alpha State in an emergency. Since this knowledge is the ultimate in treason, this is not always a good thing.
Friends: None
Enemies: Everyone
A Typical Communist Conversation:
Citizen: Excuse me, Citizen, are you cleared to be in this sector?
Comunist: Da ... I mean, "Yes," I am.
Citizen: Let me see your papers. (As he looks, another Commie, in full-dress regalia —fuzzy hat and moustache — sneaks up behind him with a bludgeon. But, just as the Commie goes to swing, his fuzzy hat falls down over his eyes and he misses wildly, overbalancing himself andfalling over a nearby catwalk railing). Hey, these authoriza¬tion forms are blank!
Communist: Da ... I mean, Ov course dey are, Comra — er, Citizen. I hafnot gotten dem signed yet.
Citizen: Well, get them signed and come back!
Communist: (Shuffles off, distraught)
Gamemaster: Congratulations, Comrade, you gain one rank in communist propa¬ganda!
Citizen (Player): Huh?
COMPUTER PHREAKS
Description: Most Computer Phreaks don't get out much. They have the extraordinary ability to live for days in front of a computer screen, typing in cryptic codes and chuckling to themselves over Algae Chips and B . They seldom meet face to face — and seldom talk when they do — but they always have plenty to say "online."
Beliefs: Play techno, live techno, break techno. Fun, chummo, fun. И	Д
Hack-n-slash, crash, baby, crash. Break surveillance an' check out that HP's live-creche. Woo! Is that a new processor? Hothothot! Live the electric transtube, dance the digital dream! 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
Hierarchy: Everyone outside the "club" is a Zoner or a Flatline. Inside, everyone is a Hacker. There are different levels of Hacker, though — usually online designations that take on their own flare. Every Hacker knows the significance of every other Hacker's filename, but no one outside the Computer Phreaks has a clue as to what they are talking about. Hacker numeric designations ("Hacker-1, Hacker-2," etc.) will have to do.
Advancement: The more creative hacking, the better. Breaking into a High Programmer's secure files and reading his abstract poetry collection is just as good as breaking into any other Ultraviolet-clearance file and downloading information. Very seldom do Computer Phreaks have a purpose to their hacking, though they will often work with other secret societies (for an exchange ofjunk food or spare parts for computers, usually) and then accomplishing "the hack" is the best thing.
Bennies: Computer Phreaks automatically gain +1 to data search and data analysis upon entering the secret society. Any Computer Phreak who makes it to "Hacker-Five" (or the equivalent — again, Computer Phreaks go by name recognition) gains a rank in computer programming.
Slaps: Hackers are seldom very good at interacting with the real world. They are usually quiet and uneasy around real people — they take a -1 to allfast talk, con, and other "people skills." These negatives do not apply if the Computer Phreak can communicate electronically instead.
Friends: Pro Tech
Enemies: Assemblers ofGod
A Typical Computer Phreak Conversation:

Computer Phreak: (Stops typing, mumbles something inaudible)
Citizen: Fine. Be that way (Leaves.)
Computer Phreak: (Resumes typing) — Ducked through the ice like it wasn't even there ... clone-o-clone, you shoulda seen me, I wasn't afraid ofnothing! I —
CORPORE МЕТАШСА
Description: Mostly, this society is made up of clones who seem to want to be bots — or cyborgs, or clones wearing bot parts and painting their skin silver. They believe (below) that clones (all organics, in fact) are obsolete, and that the sooner bots run the world, the better.
But they have a difference of opinion as to how soon that takeover should be. Some are of the opinion that it needs to be done now. They should do everything they can to hasten the process — including killing off large numbers of clones and creating self-aware bots (some of who are actually members of Corpore Metallica themselves).
Other clones (the majority) simply believe that bots are a higher form of life that clones will evolve into. There weren't bots a few hundred years ago, right? Now there are — and there are more every daycycle. It must be evolution.
(This theory makes a lot more sense when you realize that both clones and bots are created by the Computer in disturbingly similar ways — at least to the clone way of thinking.)	-
Beliefs: Most ofthese are outlined above. Many Corpore Metallicas believe that Alpha Complex is the rightful home ofbots and the Computer, and that humans should return to Outdoors. Others think that, since bots have served humans for so long, it is only right that roles should be reversed. All Corpore Metallicas believe that they should try to act and look as much like bots as humanly possible.
Hierarchy: There is no hierarchy in Corpore Metallica (unless one can become a bot), but clones who make every effort to "liberate" bots from servitude, to serve bots, and to act like bots themselves are looked on with quite a bit of favor.
Advancement: Again, no hierarchy, no advancement. However, some members become more privileged as they progress toward "bothood."

Often, clones who go balls-to-the-wall and get killed performing wanton destruction end up getting promoted or honored by the Death Leopards.
Bennies: Death Leopards gain +1 to the use of any skills that directly promote destruction or violence. Also, when a Death Leopard makes it to Lieutenant or higher levels, he has very little trouble getting equipment — such as explosives or weapons — funneled to him on a regular basis.
Slaps: They receive -1 to the use of any skills that involve thinking or planning. Also, at higher levels, they can be demoted for not performing enough acts of random violence and destruction. DLs who grow complacent often become the target of other DLs who want to move up the ladder.
Friends: PURGE, anyone who wants random violence at any particular time Enemies: Assemblers ofGod
A Typical Death Leopard Conversation:
Death Leopard: Excuse me, Citizen, may I borrow the keys to that transtube vehicle?
Citizen: Are you nuts? This is an intersector transtube! There are hundreds of clones on this train!
Death Leopard: ... not to mention the demolitions and explosives headed toward DED sector Armed Forces.
Citizen: That's right! So, ifyou'll — hey, how did you know about —
Death Leopard: (Sticking a grenade in the driver's mouth and pulling the pin) You gotta ask youself, is this a live grenade, or a dud? Do you feel lucky, punk?
Citizen: BOOOM!
Death Leopard: I guess not. (Grabs keys and starts engine) All aboard! (Accelerates transtube into red-level danger zone)
FRMKENSTEM DESTROYERS
Description: Each Frankenstein Destroyer is devoted toward kill¬ing "all humanity's immortal enemy" — the bot population of Alpha Complex. They have secret hand gestures and code words, but the most marked sign of a Frankenstein Destroyer is watching him kick the living (unliving?) crap out of a vendorbot that stole his plasticred.
Beliefs: Bots and mechanicals are evil. They make us soft, and they manipulate us. They might be controlling our minds, and they are probably poisoning us. They give off radiation, and they go berserk for no other reason than a swift kick to the gears. They need to learn their place — and that place is the garbage heap. Note: Opinons vary on whether the Computer is among those mechanicals that need to be destroyed.
Hierarchy: Each member of the FDs has a superior, noted by a letter, to whom he reports. PDA reports to FDB, and FDB reports to FDC. There are considerably more PDAs than FDBs, and the highest rank (the president of all Frankenstein Destroyers), is level R.
Advancement: Destroying bots is good, but they get repaired and rebuilt. Destroying bot factories, power recyclers, and those who build and use bots is even better.
Bennies: FDs are almost always able to contact other members of the society for help in destroying bots. They don't care about much else. Characters who advance ranks gain +1 to any robot ops and maintenance skill they wish (+1 per rank advanced), but they will seldom use these skill ranks for anything but sabotage.
Slaps: Frankenstein Destroyers will never willingly do anything in cooperation with or to help a bot. The best repairjob you could get one to do is a temporary fix with a nasty virus attached. FDs also seem to stand out among clones — bots can almost always recognize them, and try to reciprocate the clones' dislike.
Friends: PURGE
Enemies: Corpore Metallica, Pro Tech, Assemblers of God
A Typical Frankenstein Destroyer Conversation:
Frankenstein Destroyer: Just a sec, guys, I want to get a can of B3. (Puts coin in vendorbot slot)
Bot: Hi! I'm the latest in vendorbot technology — the VendoBot 6000. How may I serve you?

becomes, the lower the price is. Also, upon joining FreeEnt, characters gain +1 to their
persuasion skill values.
Slaps: FreeEnt characters are frequently slimy and interested only in turning a profit. They often turn a blind eye to danger or obvious traps when wealth is waved in front of them. They also have to watch out for traps from within their own secret society, especially ifthey are successful at what they do.
Friends: They'll sell to anyone, but they get along best with those who pay well. They get along especially well with the Politiclones.
Enemies: Communists (though they'll sell to them, too)
A Typical Free Enterprise Conversation:
FreeEnt: And now, this one time offer — Lemme tell you, it won't last long! This one- of-a-kind item is ... oh, you'll buy it? All right, 100 plasticreds. Thank you. (Pulls identical item out ofbag) All right! They're sellin' like hotcakes! What will you offer for this rare, collector's item, first edition, foil-stamped, never duplicated, poly-bagged ... urn, thingy?
fUUMWAT/
Description: Are there many Illuminati, or are there a few? Do they have an ultimate goal, or are they as directionless as they are mysteri¬ous? Are they the ones responsible for the color of that MeatLyke FoodStuf substitute I had for lunch today?
The answer to the question is the question to the answer ... is.
— A Clone claiming high rank in the Illuminati
In all likelihood, there are thousands of Illuminati in Alpha Complex, but only a handful ofthem have any idea what is going on in the secret society. The scary thing is, that select handful probably knows what's going on everywhere.
Illuminati perform strange and bizarre missions that even their senior members seem not to understand. "Fill the round bucket," or "Put the Fizz-Whiz in the cup" might be a mission, or "Kill the High Programmer" could be just as likely.
Illuminati members seldom try to figure out what's really going on. Those that do are rumored to go insane, be eliminated, or get promoted.
Beliefs: Y eah, right. We have no idea. It has something to do with gaining knowledge because knowledge is power, but, beyond that, it gets pretty fuzzy.
Hierarchy: Might as well try to figure out which FruitLip Golden cereal flake came from which food vat dispenser by looking at it. My theory is, any Illuminati who acts like he knows what's going on, doesn't, but can usually BS other members of the society into doing what he wants.
Advancement: It probably has something to do with completing missions and providing information. However, it would be just like the Illuminati to award high rank to those who defy their orders and go out on their own to discover what's going on. Of course, they might also drop a 16 ton safe on your head for doing that as well.
Bennies: The Illuminati scare other secret societies — especially really direct ones like PURGE or Death Leopards. They get a wide berth from other clones who suspect their affiliation, and often get "overlooked" when punishment duties are handed out.
Slaps: Clones tend to "crack" from the pressure of being around an Illuminati for too long, so hide your membership. They'll eventually decide the waiting is too much for them and off you, your clone family, and anyone in the immediate vicinity.
Friends: None known
Enemies: None known
A Typical Illuminati Conversation:
Illuminati: Citizen. You wish to join the Illuminati.
Initiate: Yes, oh great Illuminator. I wish to know the answers to all things. Illuminati: The answer to all things is in the palm ofy our hand, the part ofy our hair, and the fold of your robe. You must search for it and never find it, or you will never understand. The way to ignorance is through understanding.
Initiate: Huh?
Illuminati: Correct. You have passed.

MysrfCS
Description: The Mystics probably got together accidentally after a Computer-authorized chemical experiment led several clones to find they really enjoyed blowing their minds out on HappyTyme FunPills. Ever since, the Mystics have contemplated existence, non¬existence, existentialism, and exit signs with equal fervor. Most ofthe time, they try to avoid doing anything physical (except screwing off safety-seals on really highly-concentrated drugs).
Beliefs: Preferred Belief: The way to true consciousness is through the seeking ofthe Inner Light. One must cast offthe physical world to seek beyond the Veil of Appearances, the Mana ofthe Earth. Illusions and reality are one and the same — Commies, mutants, traitors, the Computer — it's all part of the same trip, man.
More Accurate Belief: Ifwe do enough HappyTyme FunPills and SpaceOut PopTops, we'll really see funky colors.
Hierarchy: Whoa. Authority. No way, man. O'course, whoever's got the coolest
chemicals is boss.
Advancement: Gettin' cool chem makes you cool... burnin' out makes you a veggie.
Bennies: All the pills you can eat, anytime. The ability to not care about anything at any time, or to get really excited about stuff that doesn't matter.
Slaps: All the pills you can eat, anytime. The ability to not care about anything at any time, or to get really excited about stuffthat doesn't matter. Yep, it's another one ofthose.
Friends: Romantics, Illuminati (or so the Mystics say)
Enemies: Death Leopards beat us up, man.
A Typical Mystic Conversation:
Mystic 1: Like, wow, man ... look at all the funky colors!
Mystic 2: (Shoving a whole bottle of pills in his nose) Dat's right, manbuh! Fun-key!
Medic: What are you guys doing?! Those are experimental hallucinogens! They'll kill
you!!
Mystic 1: (Giggles) Now he tells us! Wanna hit?
Mystic 2: Gurgle. Ack! (Thump)
Mystic 1: Bummer, man. Ack!
PourtCLOues
Description: Politiclones are usually flashy-looking clones with a high regard for personal hygiene and appearance.
Politiclones who have low Chutzpah or Moxie attributes are not likely to be more than "Supporters" (see "Hierarchy," below).
Most of the time, Politiclones are smiling, friendly, and outgoing. They talk and talk and talk and talk without saying much of anything. Ifthey are in positions of responsibility, they tend to "delegate" their responsibilities without giving up any of their authority.
However, every few weekcycles, Politiclones go through a startling transformation. They become snarling and aggressive, and they start "pointing the finger" at anyone or anything they "believe" to be against them ... though they will always say that clone or thing is "against the good of Alpha Complex." The higher up the Politiclone is in the hierarchy, the higher his targets — and, yes, many Politiclones will point the finger at the Computer (which accounts for the periodic vacuum of leadership this Secret Society experiences).
Beliefs: Make the system work for you. Exploit those who do not recognize the system for what it is by pretendftig to help them in all concerns. Try not to get caught in a lie — or in telling the wrong truth — and, above all, be popular.
Hierarchy: The lowest level Politiclones are Supporters. They help higher level Politiclones to advance in power. They are remarkably loyal and will seldom betray a higher level Politiclone unless it seems that leader is on his or her way out. There are several levels of Supporters with many different, sometimes confusing, titles. For bookkeeping purposes, the ranks "Supporter 1" through "Supporter 10" can be used.
Sector Leaders are middle-management in the Politiclones. Usually, there are about 100
SccRfr SoetiTtes 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
supporters for every Sector Leader. Sector Leaders are usually in charge of a particular sector of Alpha Complex, though the SL does not have to live in or be from that sector. The clone should visit that sector at least once every few weekcycles, however — especially during the finger-pointing period — to keep his or her popularity with the masses up.
Big Bosses are in charge of the Sector Leaders, and they are the most vocal of the Politiclones. They can getjust about any other member of the Secret Society to do just about anything they want,just by asking ... or even insinuating. The Big Bosses pretend to be friendly to each other, as well, until the finger-pointing period rolls around.
Advancement: Supporters can volunteer for and accomplish missions for their Sector Leaders. Sector Leaders can recruit new Supporters and perform missions for Big Bosses. Big Bosses can attract new Supporters, promote Sector Leaders, eliminate other Big Bosses and take on the Computer or "the system" (and survive) to advance in power and popularity.
Bennies: All Politiclones gain +1 rank in fast talk and bootlicking when they join the secret society. Supporters who advance will often receive extra training in these skills (i.e., they might receive an extra training roll at the end of an adventure in addition to what they receive normally) as a reward.
When a clone becomes a Sector Leader, he automatically gains some Supporters who will follow him loyally and perform even life-threatening missions at his request. He also automatically gains a +1 to his fast talk and motivation skills.
If a clone becomes a Big Boss, he gains +1 to his oratory, motivation, fast talk, con, and bribery skills.
Slaps: Politiclones have such an aversion to telling the truth that many other clones will sense it. So, whenever the gamemaster thinks it appropriate, force the Politiclone to make afast talk or con roll to convince a listener that he is telling the truth, even when he obviously is.
Also, the higher up in the organization the Politiclone gets, the more vocal he is. The Politiclone should be loud and vocal in all his beliefs, and should denigrate others stances or opinions whenever possible — especially if it gains him popularity in whatever group he is in. High level Politiclones die most often from not keeping their mouths shut about the Computer.
Friends: Free Enterprise (and anyone else they can chum up to)
Enemies: None (though Death Leopards aren't too popular)
A Typical Politiclone Conversation:
Politiclone: (Smiling) Friend! Have I ever told you how the service group HPD&MC is the root of all evil because it is controlling and corrupting your mind?
Citizen: Hey! I'm a worker in HPD&MC and I resent that accusation!
Politiclone: (Smiling even wider) Of course you do! That's why I asked! (Puts arm around clone's shoulder) HPD&MC is always blamed for corrupting and controlling innocent clones' minds, when it is really PLC that is the evil conniver in Alpha Complex — and they are always slandering you poor, hard-working clones in HPD&MC!
Citizen: That's right! Gee, I never thought of it that way before!
PRO Тесн
Description: A collection of individuals working together to pro¬mote the use and availability of technology in Alpha Complex, Pro Tech is composed of scientists and experiment-testers. Pro Tech penetrates vital Computer files on a regular basis (sometimes with the help of Computer Phreaks) and downloads technical information which it then uses in its own version of R&D and sells to Free Enterprise or anyone they think will promote the use of technology.
Beliefs: Techies believe in the development and sharing of new technology. They will share their secrets with anyone, providing that anyone has something that will promote the use oftechnology in return. Ignorance oftechnology is unforgivable, and those who do not use the best technology available are malicious idiots. Robots and machines are our servants and our allies and should be treated with appropriate respect.
Hierarchy: While Pro Tech has no official hierarchy, members who do more toward promoting research, design, and experimentation are considered to be of "higher rank" than those who do less.

There are, however, two "branches" of Pro Tech. Techies usually refers to the whole society, but can also refer to the scientists who develop the new technology. Harvesters are those who go out and find new information and who test new equipment—these members are actually in the majority, but they have a higher mortality rate because oftheir exposed roles.
Advancement: In the eyes ofPro Tech, getting new technological information into the hands of Pro Tech, and getting new secret society developments into the hands of the masses is the best way to advance. When clones show that they are really devoted to this, they gain more bennies and more prestige.
Bennies: Techies gain +1 to any technology-related skill (gamemaster choice) upon entering the society. In addition, most Techies are given access to experimental or even developed equipment as the society sees fit. Just about anyone can volunteer to test equipment, but developed materials only go to those who are really going to use it in the society's good.
Slaps: Pro Tech characters who do not have high technological skills often end up testing dangerous equipment. They also tend to volunteer for R&D stuff, and they have a tendency to "appropriate" equipment from missions with a high degree of regularity.

Enemies: Frankenstein Destroyers, PURGE
A Typical Pro Tech Conversation:
Techie: Here. Strap this on.
Harvester: Okay. Got it. What do these buttons do?
Techie: Wait a minutecycle, let me check the manual ... (flips through book)
Harvester: You're holding up progress!
Techie: Just a minutecycle!
Harvester: Bah! (Presses button) BOOM!
Techie: ... Well, that was the exothermic launch control. Hmmn. I wonder if he'll figure out the landing controls ...
Nope.
PS/OA/
Description: This society is very individualistic. Members do not normally congregate, except during special secret society missions, and, indeed, they rarely even contact each other. Prob¬ably, this is because the society is doubly treasonous—it promotes the use and development of mutant powers as well as hiding its existence from the Computer.
Communication from the lower echelons of the society to the higher ranks is generally done through telepathy. If a character does not have the telepathy skill, he generally has to wait for someone to contact him. Messages are sent frequently from telepaths to non-telepaths—partly because they like to keep the paths of communication open, but mainly because the telepaths like to show off.
Beliefs: Power can only be obtained through use of Power! Expand the mutant population! Stretch your mutant powers to the limit! Make contact with the inner strength! Expose yourself to radiation whenever possible!
Psion members are the next wave of evolution, and they work to hasten themselves, and everyone else, along the road ofmutation. Mutant powers are a sign of strength, and strong powers are a sign of superiority. Characters with more than one mutant power are enlightened and should be revered.
The Psionic Age ofClonekind cannot come without great suffering and sacrifice—we'll suffer, but the lower orders ofClonekind will sacrifice. Those with psionic powers are rare, and must be protected. All others can be sacrificed in the pursuit of power. Mental powers are the pure power — all other abilities are mere reflections ofthe true power.
Hierarchy: Psion leadership is determined by power and ability. Clones with powers that interact with the mind (telepathy, mind probe, etc.) are considered superior to those with less mind-specific powers (pyrokinesis, telekinesis, etc.). Clones with higher Power attributes are then higher up than clones with lower Power attributes.
It is possible for Psion clones to have more than one mutant power (see below). Those with two powers are automatically better than those with only one, as long as at least one oftheir two powers is "ofthe mind." 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. ..
Seniority does count for something as well. A clone who has been in Psion for a longer period of time usually picks up some extra Power along the way (see below) and is also generally more creative in using it. So, a beginning character with a high Power attribute and a mind-related power is not going to jump into leadership right away.
Advancement: Coming up with new and exciting way s to use mutant powers is a good way to get advancement. Gaining a secondary (or tertiary) mutation helps as well. More Power is always good ("More Power!" is the cry of many Psions).
Bennies: Uponjoining Psion, clones are immediately treated with special chemicals and exposed to radiation. Have the player roll on the following table to determine what happens:
When a clone gains a secondary mutation, he must divide his Power attribute into two parts — one part governs his old mutation, the other his new mutation (neither can be less than 1). This division is permanent, unless the character gains a new mutation. When a clone gains +1 to his Power, he gains a +1 to both Power scores.
Psion clones who advance in rank because of mission success may gain the ability to roll on this table again, receiving more adds to their Power attribute and/or more mutant powers. Every time a new mutation is developed, the Psion must divide his Power attribute amongst his current mutations. So, as Psions advance, their muta¬tions become more and more prevalent, and more and more unpredictable.
Slaps: Psion clones gain more and more disdain for the Computer's restrictions on mutant powers as they gain power themselves. They should try to use their mutant powers as often as they can, especially when they have more than one power. By the way, if a clone shows evidence of a second mutant power, the Computer will automatically execute it (or dissect it), even if the clone is a registered mutant.
Also, clones who gain more than one mutation usually start to take on physical characteristics, that are unusual among clones. The growth of a tail, horns, or an extra limb are not uncommon. At first, the disfigurement should be easy to hide, but it should get more difficult as time goes by. Eventually, clones have no choice but to flee to the Dungeon, Psion's own mutant-populated simplex.
Friends: None
Enemies: Anti-Mutant
A Typical Psion Conversation:
Psion 1: (Stares at Psion 2, brow furrowed)	'
Psion 2: (Stares back at Psion 1, beads of sweat forming on his brow) Both: Ha-ha-ha! That's a good one!
PURGE
Description: PURGE tries to be organized like an army, with footsoldiers, noncomms, lieutenants, leaders, and an overall head.
They expect the lower ranks to follow orders in a military, unques¬tioning fashion, and they expect every clone to give his or her all in the fight to rid Alpha Complex of the Computer.
This works better at some times than at others.
There is intense camraderie among PURGErs. They all believe they are doing the right thing and that to question their leaders' authority would be wrong. However, that doesn't stop them from griping about the chores and duties most of them are assigned to keep them busy while they wait for "the Big Push."
You see, unlike most other secret societies that war against the Computer, PURGE wants to fight an open, above-the-ground battle for supremacy. They are organized and trained for this, and they don't hold with terrorist acts or sneaking around.
Unfortunately, PURGE leaders know the scope of the Computer's power and seldom feel strong enough to attack even the weakest sectors of Alpha Complex with their forces. They do occasionally, if only to keep the troops from growing too restless, and sometimes they even win.
SecRer Socfirm 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
Most of the time, they get their heads ripped off and bot-oil poured down their necks.
Beliefs: Kail the Computer! The Computer sucks silicon!
The Computer is a powerful, evil foe with brainwashed soldiers and inhuman bots at Its command. We must overthrow Alpha Complex for the good of its citizens. Only an armed conflict is the true way to freedom and peace.
Butwe mustbide ourtime. Small-unit attacks and weapon raids fornow. The Big Push is waiting for us to be ready. Don't tip your hand too soon. Don't get caught with your barn door open. Don't let 'em see the whites ofyour eyes.
Hierarchy: Typical military structure, but with some unusual names. For simplicity's sake, El through E10 can be used for noncom personnel, while O1 through O10 goes for officers.
Advancement: Heroism in the face ofthe enemy is good, and displaying leadership and command skills is better. Promotion and demotion are both common in the PURGE army (I've heard ofone case where a clone was promoted from E2 — Corporeal — to O1 — Third Looie — for single-handedly destroying a Computer supply bunker and then busted down to El — Dogbreath — when PURGE command decided he should have captured it instead.
Bennies: Military discipline and patience are taught to PURGErs, and they gain +1 to their motivation and intimidation skills upon advancing past their starting rank ofE1. Also, they can requisition supplies from PURGE stores at any time ... though requisitions are filled about as well as clones normally expect from PLC.
Slaps: Boredom. Most PURGErs are terminally bored. They've been whipped up into a fighting frenzy (during their recruitment) and taught how to be patient and disciplined, and now they want to act. Most will go out oftheir way "for a little excitement" and end up getting killed in the process.
Friends: Romantics, Death Leopards (who they often use as mercenaries)
Enemies: Assemblers ofGod
A Typical PURGE Conversation:
PURGEr: (Atdebriefing) ... so, as I said before, it was all the work ofFred-R-FUN, the treasonous clone who betrayed his native Alpha Complex.
Computer: Sorry, citizen. Nice try. However, the evidence against you is overwhelm¬ing. You are the one who dropped that Algae Chip container in the hallway. You are awarded two treason points.
PURGEr: What?! No — what the hell! (pulls weapon, starts blasting at Computer screen) SMASH THE COMPUTER! THE COMPUTER SUCKS SILICON! DEATH TO THE DIGITAL DICTATOR! DESTROY —
ZapZapZapZap ... thud.
ROMAACT/CS
Description: The Romantics have somehow gained Old Reckoning knowledge and have a clearer view of the world before the Computer and Alpha Complex than any other clones in existence. This means that they are looking through a distorted mirror covered with mud, but at least they can see something.
Romantics are infatuated with anything that came from, or might have come from, the Old Reckoning, especially the 20th Century (which they call "the Y ear of the Fox" for some reason). At meetings, they play games like "footbot" and watch TeeBee" and like to pretend they are back in "the Good Old Day cycles." Most male clones stick plumbing supplies stuffed with brown paper into their mouths and "smoke" them, while most female clones cut their nice Computer-suppliedjumpsuits into dressing and stuff them in roasted turnkeys (which really upsets the turnkeys, I can tell you).
Beliefs: The Old Ways are the Good Ways. The Computer is our enemy, since It won't let us seek our history and our ancestry. We should all be allowed to dress like they did during the Fox years and talk in funny accents.
Hierarchy: Those who emulate the Old Reckoning ways are best. Of course, since no one really knows the difference between the Old Reckoning and Alpha Complex—except that they wore funny clothes, talked in silly accents, and spent a lot of time watching vidmonitors — a good con man can rise high in the society.

ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
Advancement: Going into the Outdoors or the oldest, restricted parts of Alpha Complex and finding Old Reckoning artifacts is a good way to get promoted. Finding uses for these artifacts is a sign of intelligence. Spreading "the word" about the Old Reckoning ain't bad, either.
Bennies: All clones in this secret society gain +2 to any skill or skill base attempts to figure out Old Reckoning equipment or knowledge. They know a considerable amount about the "old days," though mostly in the form of old television shows, movies, and, above all, commercials — all these records survived in the Computer's memory banks, and have been accessed from time to time. When in the Outdoors, clones from the Romantics experience a little less disorientation and can use their survival skills as ifthey were in Alpha Complex.
Slaps: Romantics can't stop talking in buzz-words and 20th Century terms. They will work stories of the Old Reckoning into any conversation, acting as if everyone under¬stands what they're talking about. Unfortunately, some clones and the Computer will, and knowledge of the Old Reckoning is treason.

A Typical Romantics Conversation:

Romantic: Just do it! No excuses! Guess!
Citizen: That's not a lot of help, Barn-Y.
SfAi CLUB
Description: Seal Clubbers are fascinated with the Outdoors. They love dirt, plants, animals — everything about the Outdoors. Sure, most of them have never actually seen the Outdoors or even anything from the Outdoors, but they know all the right words.
Seal Clubbers are always making plans to "go back to nature," to "go camping," and to "save the wildlife." They aren't sure what "nature" is,
"camping" sounds vaguely unsanitary, and "wildlife" might have some¬thing to do with the Death Leopards.
Most of the Seal Clubbers are actually just rebelling against the closed-in space of Alpha Complex. They think ofanything largerthan a normal creche as "Outdoors"—until their superiors reprimand them and assign them dirt-finding duty.
Beliefs: The domes of Alpha Complex should be opened so that the sun can shine in (the sun is a great, flourescent light suspended from a giant tree. It runs on solar power, so it goes out every nightcycle).
But, ifwe can't get that done, we must return to our roots. We must plan expeditions to go Outdoors, and we must follow through. Return clonekind to the safety of Outdoors. where we can experience wind, rain, snow, and — that newest ofweather developments, available only just before we all came inside — smog.
The Computer is our enemy, because It keeps us indoors and hides from us the wonders of Outdoors. Fighting the Computer is good, especially when it leads to more knowledge about the Outdoors.
Hierarchy: Lower level Seal Clubbers are called Dirt-boys, because they are in charge of collecting the simplest of Outdoors supplies: dirt. Seal Clubbers don't know what dirt's for, but they know it must be an important part ofOutdoors, because there certainly seems to be a helluvalot of it. They try to bathe as infrequently as possible, and often run afoul of hygiene inspections and scrubots.
Earthy-crunchies are devoted toward collecting food supplies for the expeditions. Since they do not want to depend on Alpha Complex synthefood (except Algae Chips, which they all seem to like), they try to find "real" nutrients for the society. They know dead animals are good (at least our ancestors liked 'em), and they try to collect water that has not been soiled by the Computer's sanitation processes.
Earth Mothers and Earth Fathers are the elders of the society, and they will lead the communes when we get Outdoors. They are in charge of handing out missions and of directing the expeditions. Other than that, they just sit around and try not to bathe.
Advancement: Collection things from Outdoors is the best way to advance. Bringing back live animals or insects — or actual people who've lived Outdoors — is great. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. ..
Knowledge of Outdoors is good. Rumor has it that the founder of the Seal Clubbers brought back an "Oy Snout Manual" and that was what the club was based on.
Bennies: Seal Clubbers, like Romantics, are not disoriented by being Outdoors. However, they also gain a +2 to their survival rolls Outdoors. Also, Seal Clubbers are naturally resistant to serious diseases and even low-level radiation.
Slaps: They stink. The Computer places high priority on personal hygiene, and Seal Clubbers are the reverse. Also, the periodically get sick from eating or drinking things they think are healthy, and should periodically be at minuses to skill checks because of it. F inally, Seal Clubbers don't like most technology and will try to avoid using higher tech ifthey can — especially if there seems to be a low tech alternative available.

Enemies: Pro Tech, Corpore Metallica

TREKKERS
General Description: This secret society has changed greatly over the years. Now, it seems to be very large, very powerful, but very fractionalized. Trekkers, however, are fairly good at banding together when they have to.
Most Trekkers are would-be technology freaks — even though many ofthem can't even replace a bot's eye bulb without electrocut¬ing themselves. They have a disturbing tendancy to boast of their secret society membership when they can be overheard — not to mention the fact that many of them wear strange outfits and paraphenalia openly. They use strange code words and gestures ("Vat long and prospect," and "Bake it so") that will elicit knowing smiles from each other and looks of bewilderments from others.
Beliefs: It's a big, strange Complex out there, and we have to explore it, battling societal oppression and ignorance along the way, No, wait; we know everything we really need to know, we just have to go out and observe but not interfere. No, that's still not it — I know, let's just sit here and wait until something nasty and powerful shows up and kills us. No, that was just a dream.
Maybe we should have a meeting.
(Do you see what I mean about the society being fractured?)
"We know better than everybody else and we're damn proud of it" does seem to be accurate, however.
Hierarchy: There are the Fans who practically worship the other members of this strange organization. Often, Fans are told to go somewhere and hold meetings — at which time they will do this instantly, ignoring all other orders and directives from any other source. When they arrive, they will spend millions of plasticreds for the privilege of meeting other members of their secret society, watching vidtapes of those members in action, and to eat stale Algae Chips and drink PepsoDismal (a subdivision ofthe beverage Bouncy Bubble Beverage). At the end of this "convocation," they will bid each other farewell and head back to whatever they were doing in the first place.
Redshirts are the next level of Trekker. Oddly enough, there are a lot ofthem, when they are the order with the highest mortality rate. It is the Redshirt's duty to throw herself in the line of fire whenever the opportunity presents itself— or to volunteer to test new equipment, or for particularly suicidal missions, or what have you. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
Officers make up the bulk of the Trekkers. There are at least ten ranks of Officer (01 thru O10 will work until you can come up with something more imaginative), and they are all good at bossing Redshirts around (indeed, they seem to be in charge of getting the poor saps killed) and kowtowing to the Bridge Crew (below).
Bridge Crew clones are few and far between — though the number has been growing steadily. There are several different Bridge Crews in existence, each with its own internal hierarchy (sorry, I can't explain it better than that), each vying for ultimate dominance in the Secret Society. A Bridge Crew Trekkie is worshipped by all other ranks (and idolized by the Fans), though generally hated by any member of another Bridge Crew or even by other members ofhis or her own Bridge Crew (though this animosity is usually shielded from everyone else in the Secret Society). It was once rumored that Bridge Crewers obtained some secret technology that allowed them to have unlimited clones, but that may j ust be a rumor.
Advancement: Fans can seldom advance—most player character Trekkies have the option of beginning as Fans or Redshirts. Fans seldom have to take on Secret Society missions (other than the occasional convocation), but they do not gain much in the way of respect, except from other Fans.
Redshirts advance to Officer level by surviving one or more important Secret Society missions. Since Redshirts are only sent on the most dangerous missions, with orders that will practically guarantee their deaths, this is a good weeding-out process.
Officers move up through the ranks slowly, because they are seldom given high profile or dangerous missions. If an Officer becomes too popular in the Secret Society, however, the Bridge Crew will move to eliminate him, generally by giving him several Redshirt- type missions one after another. If he survives, regardless of his current rank, he will probably be promoted to Bridge Crew — especially if he can arrange for the elimination of one of the Bridge Crew, or he is willing to jump from one Bridge Crew to another, less popular, Crew in the secret society.
Bridge Crew clones do not advance unless they can make other Bridgers look bad or transfer out. The death ofa Bridge Crew leader will sometimes cause the promotion of an old Bridger but, most likely, it will result in the dissolution of that Bridge Crew, and all those Bridgers will end up transfered or as simple Officers again. For this reason, Bridge Crewers may snipe and battle with each other, but they will seldom actually try to kill each other.
Bennies: Fans mysteriously seem to be able to come up with hundreds ofplasticreds at a moment's notice — especially if there is a convocation coming up. However, they also spend their plasticreds as quickly as they get them, usually on useless stuff.
Upon becoming a Redshirt, the clone gains +1 rank in laser weapons and dodge. Officers gain +1 rank in oratory and motivation. Bridge Crew members gain +2 in oratory and motivation.
An Additional Bennie: This secret society has a hard time keeping itself secret. However, since they seem to care about nothing but their strange hierarchy, they cause little trouble for the Computer, who pretty much ignores them. Granted, membership in any secret society is treason, but the Computer will often turn a blind eye to Trekkers who don't cause too much trouble.
Slaps: Trekkers can often annoy other secret societies by spouting their beliefs publicly (and getting away with it) or bragging about the success of their higher level members on their latest missions (and still get away with it).
Officers ofthe Trekker secret society are loathe to use violence, and will often hesitate in combat — usually trying to use their oratory or motivation skills to get out of trouble. Bridge Crew members will almost never use violence, even if it means they will be killed — unless they can rationalize their violence as "helping others who cannot help themselves."
Friends: Free Enterprise, Romantics
Enemies: Death Leopards, PURGE

SECRET SOC/ET/ES w PLAY
Secret societies are yet another "pull" gamemasters have on players. Can't think up an interesting mission for the Troubleshooters today? Give 'em a simple patrol and then work in a half-dozen secret society missions as well. Don't have a clue how to get them to move from Part One of the adventure to Part Two? Have a secret society ally show up and give them a clue. Everyone playing too nice together? Start a secret society war and watch the fur fly!
Secret societies are meant to be secret... about as secret as everything else in Paranoia. In other words, your players will figure out the game fairly quickly, but not before you've had some fun. Then, they'll have to have fun pretending they don't know about secret societies any more and you can execute anyone who slips up.
PLAYER HANDOUTS 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY.
Society Table, hand him the appropriate section. This is the average amount of informa¬tion a character should have about a secret society he has justjoined. It has a list of any automatic "bennies" and "slaps" he receives — that he should know about — and some fairly inaccurate information about the society and a logo. If a character does not know he is a secret society, hand him the "No Society" card, with the fake logo and information there. That way, everybody gets something, so nobody knows who is in a secret society and who, supposedly, isn't.
On the cards are blanks for Secret Society Missions. We encourage you to use these cards more than once, photocopying them as you see fit, and filling out this blank every time you play. That way, you can give out secret society missions in cryptic, short-and-to- the-point ways, just as if the player were inside Alpha Complex. No questions can usually be asked, and the playerjust has to make do with the information he gets.
SeCRiT Soc/BTY MfSSfOMS
Every adventure should contain a secret society mission for someone. Often, the mission will have nothing to do with the party's overall adventure, but, sometimes, it will directly involve whatever's going on. Whenever possible, secret society missions should force normally unco-operative clones to work together, or normally compatible clones to strive against each other.
That "pull" thing again.
Ideas for secret society missions can be derived from the descriptions of the societies, particularly their notes under "Advancement." Sometimes, Troubleshooters will be given very general missions — like a Death Leopard will be told "Disrupt as many Computer files as possible" — that will be made more interesting by the circumstances — the Troubleshooters are told to guard a damaged Computer node in sector IRQ.
Other times, the missions will be very specific. "Clone Care-I-ARE is an IntSec agent transporting files concerning PURGE activities to the Armed Forces. Kill her and get the files," might be a mission. But who is it for? Did PURGE assign the mission (logical) or did the Assemblers of God (they might want to use the information to cripple their enemies).
Try to keep secret society missions from being too easy to figure out and accomplish. Actually, their complexity should vary, depending on the complexity of the group's mission — if the group's mission is straightforward, weave an intricate web of secret society missions around it, making the overal adventure more complex. The following passage provides a good example.
THE RAO/OACT/UE SLUDGE FROM (TAT #S
This Computer mission involves a group of heavily-armed Troubleshooters and a jackobot equipped with sensor equipment. The Computer wants the Troubleshooters to go into the bowels of ICK sector and determine what has caused the recent disappearance of several PLC (Commissary-branch) technicians from Vat Area #5.
The Troubleshooter team consists offour characters: the Mission Leader, Gung-I-DIN- 3; the Loyalty Officer, Mas-O-KST-5; the Hygiene Officer (it's dirty down there), Mell-0- YLO-4, and the Morale Officer, Space-I-KAS-6. The Troubleshooters are armed with all manner ofweapons and armor, and given the order: Find out what's happening and stop it.
But, before the Troubleshooters make it down to the food vats, their secret societies contact them.
First, Gung-I-DIN-3, who is a Pro Tech Harvester, is told that one of the weapons the team has been assigned — the super-powerful, R&D "Blastomatic" cannon — should be "acquired" for Pro Tech examination. It should not be fired before Pro Tech can get their hands on it, because it could be destroyed.
Second, Mas-O-KST-5, an Anti-Mutant, has been informed that Gung-I-DIN-3 is a mutant, and has been targeted for termination. Mas-O is instructed to "make it look like an accident," however, since Gung-I is such a high-ranking clone.
Third, Mell-O-YLO-4 is a Seal Clubber, and is informed that her mission is twofold: make sure that no one maintains good hygiene and, second, bring back any new organisms found in the food vat area, so they can be examined by the society. Do not allow them to come to harm!
Last, Space-I-KAS-6 is a Mystic, and his orders are, like, to make sure that, whoa, everybody in ICK sector gets a real trip. Like, they want him to dose the food vats with 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
a really potent upper, man, and that's about it. Oh, an' here's some pills for the trip.
So, the conflict has been established. Everyone is supposed to be out hunting for whatever is taking the PLC workers, but they all have their own agendas. As it turns out, the Blastomatic is the only weapon that can possibly harm the Creature from Vat #5 that's been eating the PLC workers, but Gung-I orders it not be used. Mas-O sees this as a way to get the other team members on his side, and accuses Gung-I oftreason (not carrying out the Computer's orders), and tries to wrestle the weapon away from him.
Meanwhile, Mell-O sprays them both with the most unhygienic stuff she can find (Computer Cetchup, the Sauce That Makes Your Synthemeat Stand Up and Scream), which, in turn, attracts the very hungry creature. While she tries to make friends with it, Space-I dumps his drug into the food vats and, because of distance, is the last one consumed when the Creature eats its way through the party.
Another successful mission.

Regardless ofwhat they may believe, every citizen of Alpha Complex has a mutant power—that means every player character does, too. Mutations are dangerous and they are treasonous, so most clones try to hide them as much as they can. Of course, citizens can confess their mutanthood and be branded "Registered Mutants" (see "Character Creation" in the Players' Section), but most just try to hide out.
The cause of mutant powers in Alpha Complex is a mystery. The Computer has declared that mutant powers are an abomination and the result of Commie traitor tampering with Its clone banks, but It has also stated that Its clone banks are inviolate and that no one could possibly tamper with them. Somebody's full ofvat sludge.
Mutant powers may have come about as a result of tampering, or they may have been caused by background radiation from the Big Oops (the end of the rest of the world). Or, maybe, mutant powers are caused by the recycled food vat nutrients every clone eats, or perhaps the radiation of under-shielded reactors in Alpha Complex has messed with the clones' chromosomes. Or maybe the fact that the Computer has been cloning from the same tissues and templates for so long ...
Sigh. You get the picture. There are lots of different ways this could have happened. The important thing is, it did.
How Mt/гм/т Powefts И/ORK „ OR DOMT
Troubleshooters and citizens who wantto use their mutant powers have to say they are doing so to the gamemaster. They might do this out loud (ifthey are registered mutants or very foolish) or they could pass a note or indicate this in some other way. In addition, they must declare what they want their mutant power to do, before they try it.
This is important, because the gamemaster will then call for a Power check. A Power check is just like any other attribute or skill check - the character's Power score counts as his skill value and it is read on the Check Chart and cross-referenced with a difficulty level or number the gamemaster determines. Ifthe Power check is successful, the mutant power does pretty much what the player wanted (or said — important distinction). If the roll is a failure, either nothing happens or the power goes haywire ... it's up to the gamemaster.
Some mutant powers are sneakier than others. Troubleshooters may be able to attempt the use of mutant powers in utmost secrecy (as long as they don't blow it too bad). Other mutant powers are obvious, and cannot be hidden. As a result, Troubleshooters should only use their powers when they really mean it. Don't tell them that, though — make them find out for themselves.
POWER CHECK 0/тшту
To determine how hard or easy a Power check should be, first read the Mutant Power description (see below) and then check out these guidelines. They should help you figure out how hard or easy a mutant power attempt should be.

ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
•	Simple — The use ofthe power is minor, and falls well within the parameters set by the description. Examples could include: lighting a hand-held piece ofpaper with pyrokinesis; using hypersenses to hear what's behind a door; using x-ray vision to see through normal clothing.
•	Easy — The use of the power is moderate, but still is not a stretch of its parameters: lighting the fuse on a stick of dynamite with pyrokinesis; using regeneration to heal the character's only wound; using telekinesis to flip a nearby switch.
•	Normal — The most common range of mutant power use. The attempt is well-defined by the power's description, but does present some strain. Trying to set clothing on fire with pyrokinesis; using x-ray vision to see through a normal wall; teleporting to the edge of sight distance.
•	Tough — Either the attempt is naturally hard, or the mutant power description is being "stretched": Using TK to manipulate fine instruments (like a pistol's trigger while aiming it); using teleport to move to an unseen but nearby area; using precognition to determine the likely outcome of an adventure.
•	Difficult (or higher) — The player really wants to turn the mutant power into a "super" power. He is trying something either not really covered by the mutant power, or he is trying something really, really hard. Using TK to lift a fiybot out of a pond might cover it; using electroshock to erase a computer's memory without damaging the actual computer could be another.
Again, try to keep your humor intact for mutant power uses. Anything creative and funny — but not unbalancing to your scenario — should be given a decent chance of succeeding. Likewise, when characters try to use their mutant powers to succeed where thought and roleplaying have failed, make them pay.
How ОЕТЕЛ/ САА/ THEY Use TPE/R POWERS?
There are two ways to handle this. First, ifyou don't care how many times they use their powers — or you have them scared enough about being found out as mutants — you might let them just use them whenever-they want and not worry about it. On the other hand, ifyou want to restrict mutant power use, you can go with the following system.
Every time a mutant power is used (successfully or unsuccessfully), the Trouble¬shooter subtracts one from his current Power attribute. The character uses the new attribute in following attempts, subtracting a cumulative one every time. Ifthe character ever reaches zero, he can no longer use his mutant power.
The character gets Power points back at the end of an adventure, when you say he has had time to rest (you may award some or all points at briefbreaks) or when the character uses special mutant power-enhancing drugs to boost his Power score. Of course, that last is treason (and rare — only Psion has many of those kinds of drugs, though the Mystics might help you out), but then so are mutant powers.
OPT/OA/AC RULE: /Л/CREASWG YOUR POWER
Gamemasters may, ifthey think mutants are using their powers to good effect, allow characters to increase their Power attributes at the end of an adventure. Psion characters should be allowed to do this, even if no one else is (it's a big part of their secret society).
Have the character roll a d20. If the result is higher than the character's Power attribute, the attribute is permanently (well, until you say otherwise) increased by one point. If the result is equal to or lower than the character's Power attribute, there is no change. On a one (critical failure), the character loses a point of Power.
THE MUTAHT POWER OESCR/PT/OHS
Each mutant power is described below, along with some recommended "extra" mechanics. Disregard any you don't want to use (that includes whole powers —just make the players reroll) and make everything else up as you go along.
There are a few constants for mutant powers. All mutant powers are only used in ways the gamemaster deems acceptable (well, duh). The gamemaster can say any attempt succeeds or fails regardless ofthe die roll (show players who argue this passage and then execute their characters — this is an Ultraviolet section, after all).
The effects of mutant powers last as long as you say. Normally, a mutant power has 
an "instant" effect, but, sometimes, powers last longer. No mutant power attempt should last more than five minutes or so — but, in terms offive-second combat rounds, that can be an eternity.
Range and area of effect are defined by the power, but, for most powers, line of sight and scope of imagination are the key. If a character says he wants his Pyrokinesis to set a whole acre ofwoods (sorry, "strange, brown poles with green stuffon top") on fire, he can give it a shot — it's probably ridiculous. Likewise, a character who wants to use mental blast on someone he can't directly see (like through a camera) is asking for a really high modifier.
AORENAUNE CONTROL
Characters with this power can boost their physical capabilities — Strength, Agility, Endurance, and Dexterity — by using it. All derived values (like Macho and HTH Damage) are refigured temporarily when the skill attempt succeeds. All skill bases and dependent skill ranks increase as well.
If the character succeeds at his Power check, he can do all sorts of amazing things — lift ten times his carrying capacity, leap tall bots in a single bound, and shrug off damage like a superhero.
However, the power has a price. When the effects wear off (maximum offive minutes, or when whatever crisis prompted the power use ends), the character takes a wound from the strain. He also takes any damage that he "ignored" during the adrenaline control use. So, for five minutes (or less), he is just about invincible — after that, he collapses or, at the very least feels very, very tired.
GM: Okay, the Commies are firing their puny lasers at you, but you ignore their feeble efforts. Picking up the nearby jackobot, you hurl it in their direction. It explodes in a ball of fire, killing or scattering your enemies. You look around, and all is calm. (Checks accumulated damage and adds one wound.) Ooh, you'd probably have a nasty hernia, ifyou didn't collapse from all those "puny" laser blast holes.
CHARM
Glands underneath the character's skin allow him to voluntarily secret pheromone¬like chemicals into the air. These pheromones affect every living organism within a nearby area (the larger the desired area, the harder the Power check), making everyone — including the character himself— feel generally agreeable and relaxed. Only charac¬ters encased in life-support gear (a general gas-mask won't do it; the chemical can go through the skin) are immune. Naturally, the Computer, bots, and other non-living entities are immune.
The mutant himselfcan resist this feeling ofharmony to some extent. He can act freely, but should not attempt violence unless provoked by violence. Other characters are very open to suggestion. The mutant gains +10 to all "positive" interaction attempts (fast talk, con, and bribery are good examples — intimidation is not).
The difficulty of the Power check should be based on how many characters the mutant is trying to affect, the range between the mutant and the affected characters, and the general attitude of the affected characters.
GM: A moment ago, the Vulture Troopers and IntSec agents were all ready to fry your bacon for treason — now, they seem generally pacifistic and happy. Maybe now would be a good time to slip off. Oh, no, that big agent has wrapped his big arms around you and is giving you a hug. (Clatter of dice.) Ouch! What's your Macho Stat again?
OTEP PROBE
This power is used when the mutant wants to search a target's mind for specific information. The more specific the information, the harder the Power check; the more familiar the target is with the information, the easier. For example, searching a bot technician's mind for the "Emergency Off toggle on a jackobot would probably be easy, while probing that same technician's mind for a detailed schematic of a Vulture Warrior Flybot's artificial intelligence would be nearly impossible.
However, good roleplaying can make deep probe attempts easier. If the character can get the target relaxed (less likely to resist) and thinking about the needed information (closer to the top of the target's mind), then the difficulty level should be reduced. On the other hand, if the target is naturally suspicious and trying to hide the information, the attempt should be harder. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
Deep probe is not a subtle power. It only takes an instant, but targets can detect it. Have the target make a Chutzpah check against the mutant's current Power attribute immediately after the deep probe attempt is made — whether it succeeds or not. If the character fails, he has vague feeling ofunease. If he succeeds, he knows someone was in his mind. It is up to the gamemaster to determine ifhe has an idea who was probing him.
EUCTROSHOCK
The character can channel static electricity through his body and store it like a battery. The mutant is very resistant to any type of electrical or neural attack (+5 Macho against stunguns and neural weapons), and can generate an attack ofhis own merely by pointing a finger at a character within a five meter range.
The damage value ofthe attack is equal to the mutant's current Power attribute plus 1d10. The damage is Energy (E). The character can continue generating electroshock attacks until he runs out ofPower. When the character attacks using electroshock, he first makes a Power check to see if the electroshock discharge "goes off," and then he makes a check against the target's Agility (or a difficulty level determined by the gamemaster) using his current Power attribute times two. The difficulty of dodging a successful zap is difficult, because of the way the static energy surrounds a target's body.
EMPATHY
Similar to the charm power, empathy actually allows a character to read a target's emotional state and attempt to impose his own emotions on that target.
The Power check is against the target's Chutzpah, plus or minus modifiers based on how close the target already is to the desired emotion, and plus or minus modifiers based on how close the gamemaster feels the mutant is to the emotional state he is trying to create — remember, the emotion is supposed to be coming from the mutant. Ifthe mutant character is not able to emulate the emotion desired (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc.), then there is nothing to be transfered. 
  
 


















 
When player characters use this power, they must roleplay it. If the player is just matter-of-factly declaring he wants the target to feel fear, and not trying to roleplay any fear himself, then the gamemaster is encouraged to modify the difficulty number up a few notches. On the other hand, if the player is cowering under the table and whimpering — which players have been known to do from time to time anyway — then modifying the difficulty downwards is probably a good idea as well.
Remember, though, that, in most cases, the mutant is play-acting. He is stirring up real, but probably controlled, emotions in his own mind. When the empathy power works, the target is possessed by the emotion projected and loses control of his own emotions. Unfortunately, the way emotional people act can be very, very unpredictable.
GM: All right, the Commies and mutants are enraged and going berserk. They're beating each other with clubs and screaming at the top of their lungs. Pete, would you please stop screaming and get off the table now?
ENERGY Frew
When using this power, the mutant creates a bubble of energy within a few centimeters of his body that both surrounds him and absorbs and disperses energy the comes it contact with it.
The field is most effective against energy attacks — flame, laser, sonic, etc. — and less effective against kinetic energy. The mutant makes a Power check when he wants the energy field to come on—usually against a difficulty level of easy, but this can be modified by the situation — and it shimmers to life. There is a distinct glow around the character when the field comes to life.
The character receives E6L6B1P1I1 armor while the energy field is up. The field lasts for about one to five minutes, depending on the gamemaster's whim (the character has to concentrate slightly on the power; if something really radical happens to disturb him, then he loses the field).
The character's energy field also affects weapons and energy cells he is holding. In general, all energy or laser weapons lose one point of ammo per round when the mutant holding them, and, when the mutant attacks someone while the energy field is up, the target gains his armor bonuses as well — since the attack is through his field.
HYPERSENSES
While this power is up, the mutant gains extraordinary use of his five senses. Everything is amplified — sounds, lights, smells, tastes... everything. The mutant is also able to regulate this increase to some extent — he won't be deafened by a pin dropping or blinded by a flashlight.
When the mutant makes his Power check, he usually goes against a difficulty level of easy. He then gains extremely high pluses to any type of perception check, and the gamemaster is encouraged to allow the character to automatically see, hear, smell or otherwise sense things automatically that he wouldn't even normally get a skill check to find.
Unfortunately, extreme sensory input will injure or disturb the character while hypersenses is up. A really loud noise—like an explosion — does damage to the character as ifit were an attack. Armor doesn't help.'but Macho does, and all senses can be assaulted like this. The effects are varied, but they are usually moderately injurious (a grenade would do damage value 8 plus 1 d 10) and they usually carry some sort of additional penalty (the character might be deaf for an hour).
GM: Okay, your hypersenses are on. You search through the wreckage of the V ulture Warrior, spotting microscopic traces of plastique and a detonator. Even a doberbot would be hard-pressed to sniff these clues out!
And speaking of sniffing ... (Clatter of dice) ... oooh, what was that the Vulture Warrior crashed in? Smells like a sewer, only a hundred times worse. You take a wound as your nostrils fill with fire, and you are hacking and coughing uncontrollably. You'll be stunned for the next five rounds and ... uh, oh, it looks like some treasonous scavenger-citizens have shown up to have a look at the flybot...
IEY/TAT/ON
The mutant has the power to counteract the force of gravity, but only as regards himself | and whatever he is carrying.
The base difficulty level is easy, but should be increased if the character wants to rise 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
quickly, wants the ability to "fly" (normally, the
character can only go up and down fairly slowly — if the character puts special effort into it, he might be able to float in a particular direction as well) or if the character is carrying more than his normal carrying capacity.
When the Power check succeeds, the charac¬ter floats up into the air, usually with the speed of a leaf falling ... only upwards. The character can control his height and can come down eas-
iiy.
Unfortunately, the power is unpredictable in its duration. The gamemaster should deter¬mine randomly how long it will last in any given instant — one to five minutes is standard (roll 1d10, divide by two, and round up). If the character is still airborne when the power wears off, he falls. Determine damage from falling as you wish ... usually a ten meter fall has a damage value of 8, with the damage increasing by one for every additional two meters, but the result is really up to you.
While the character is airborne, he is subject to wind currents, airborne attacks, and other problems. The character cannot effectively dodge and his Agility (for purposes of being hit by attacks) is halved while he is in the air — even if the character is "flying," he is doing so very slowly and predictably.
MACH we EMPATHY
WARNING! WARNING! ALL MUTANT POWERS ARE TREASON, BUT THIS ONE IS REALLY BAD! SUMMARY EXECUTION UPON DETECTION — NO EXCEPTIONS!
Mutants with this power are rare in Alpha Complex. This is the only mutation that cannot be registered, and any mutant with machine empathy will be executed upon detection.
You see, machine empathy works like the charm power, only on machines. Jackobots, vendorbots, docbots, warbots, and, yes, the Com-puter Itself, are all affected.
The difficulty of this Power check is usually normal, but it can be adjusted for the intelli¬gence and security level of the target machine. Warbots are usually stupid, but they have lots of nasty scramblers and hidden codes, so they are tough to influence. Docbots are intelligent, but they are also easily ordered around anyway, so they are normal. Most fixed-placement bots and general-purpose bots, like vendorbots, scrubots, and Jackobots are easy to manipulate. The Computer should never be easier than difficult to affect, though there are circumstances where It would be much harder to influence.
Basically, after the character succeeds in his roll, friendship and camaraderie develop between the bot and the clone. The machine will override internal directives to be friendly to the clone and will attempt to do what the clone wants. Of course, many machines are too stupid or too limited to be of much use, but having a Mark IV Warbot as your bestest buddy will get that nasty Team Leader off your back right quick.
The best thing about machine empathy is, because ofthe way most machines are built, at the end of the duration of the power (about five minutes), the machine will probably completely forget about what transpired. It will assume that whatever it did was according to its basic programming — possibly a buried subdirectory command or a running internal loop — and will pick up where it left off. This is good if you need to 
persuade ajackobot to carry a heavy load a hundred meters for you, or a warbot to launch atacnuke at a particularly unsympathetic IntSec agent, but not so helpful ifyou have just talked a Vulture Warrior flybot out of ejecting you from its cockpit. "Die flybot will agree and you'll have a really pleasant conversation — for about five minutes, after which it will eject you as per its initial instructions.
The Computer is the only definite exception to this rule. Because ofIts countless back¬up circuits and sector nodes, the Computer is continuously analyzing Its files for tampering and attempts at tampering — the Computer will analyze the discrepancy and, if It cannot rationalize why It performed a particular action or set of actions, It will investigate and probably determine the cause: Commie mutant traitor tampering.
Then again, if the mutant is clever and uses his power to head offtrouble (rather than as a last resort), the Computer might just put down the discrepancy as "a discretionary alteration in operating parameters" and let it slide.
For now ...
MATTER EATER
Not as useless a power as it may at first seem, matter eater allows a character to ingest and process any form ofmatter into his system. Anything that... ahem ... comes out later turns up as organic material.
The use of the power is simple for organic substances—any type of food, even poisonous or tainted — can be swallowed and digested at no harm to the subject. After that, increase the difficulty level by how nasty a particular "food" is. However, it has been recorded that a registered mutant, trapped in an enemy simplex, devoured an entire Commie flybot while waiting for rescue. The mutant was given a commendation for valor and a PeptoPill for a mild case of indigestion and returned to active duty.
As this implies, matter eaters can also bite through and chew really tough materials. They can chew through plasticrete, steel, and even titanium (given time and something to wash it down). Because ofthe time involved, however, their teeth are no more effective as weapons than anyone else's, but it is intimidating to see a matter eater go to work. A particular registered matter eater from HPD&MC's entertainment division reputedly had the audience in the aisles when he, quite literally, chewed the scenery. I believe his name was Billshat-I-NER.
MeCHAA/fCAl /NTUTT/ON
This is a nice, subtle power for a mutant. It is virtually undetectable — except by suspicion — and could be quite useful (ifmutant powers were really useful).
When confronted by an unfamiliar mechanical device (possibly a really advanced R&D piece, or an ancient Old Reckoning artifact), the mutant can make a Power check based on a difficulty set by the gamemaster. Ifthe roll succeeds, the mutant understands what the device is for, how to work it, and, roughly, how to attempt repairs on it should it break (that last depends mostly on how high the character's Mechanical Aptitude is).
If the roll fails, however, the character still believes he knows how to use it — but something has gone terribly, terribly wrong. Ifthere is a way for the character to operate the mechanism in a way that is dangerous to himself and others, he will do so when the opportunity arises.
MENTAL BLAST
This power assault's the target's mind. It goes through all physical defenses and damages the target mentally. Fortunately, mental damage has the same game effects as physical damage, so there are no need for extra "mental wound" rules to be invented. (Isn't it funny how that worked out?)
The base difficulty number of succeeding at a mental blast is equal to the target's Chutzpah, modified for surprise, range (about five meters is the normal maximum) and the number oftargets affected (use the target with the highest Chutzpah as the one being attacked). Ifthe attack succeeds, then the target takes damage equal to 1d10 plus the mutant's current Power total. The only thing that subtracts from this damage is the target's Chutzpah skill base.
POlVMORPHfSM
A 25-plasticred way to say "shape-changing." Using this mutant power, a clone can alter his shape and size by force of will. Mimicking other clones is easiest—the colorations 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
and consistency appear the same — while changing into inanimate, nonhuman objects (like tables or garbage vats) is harder.
The player must clearly state what shape he wants to take, and then make a Power check. The base difficulty level is easy (for non-specific other clone forms) going up as high as the gamemaster wishes for more intricate changes.
The more specific the character's description, the easier the change should actually be — for example, if Roy-G-BIV had this power and wanted to look like Tray-TOR, he could say "I want to look like Tray-TOR" and make a Power roll. While Roy is referring to a very specific clone, the description isn't actually very specific. Roy, in order to get good modifiers, should describe, in detail, Tray-TOR's physical appearance to the gamemaster to show that he has noticed all the details he can.
The mutant remains changed for one to five minutes — he has no control over this — and can change back only when the duration (randomly determined by the gamemaster) is up.
PRiCOMfTfOM
You knew I was going to do this power now, didn't you?
The mutant has the very imprecise and very limited ability to see into the future. There are two ways the gamemaster can run this — he can allow the player to control his attempts at precognition, or he can control them himself. There are benefits to both systems.
With player control, the character will get to a point in the adventure and tell the gamemaster that he would like to use his precognition to determine what is going to happen next. The character then makes a Power check (the difficulty is usually easy, modified upwards for the complexity of the upcoming situation and by how much the gamemaster doesn't want the players to know what's happening) and the gamemaster describes in as vague or as specific terms as he wants what he thinks will happen. However, the future is a mutable thing — merely by asking for a precognition check, the clone may be changing the future. How's that for a gamemaster kludge?
If the gamemaster controls the use of precognition, he should call for a Power check much as he would call for a perception check — when he thinks something might happen that the clone could "pick up," or when he wants the clone to think something could be 
  
 
и/."I нс/ 		 I.I'H-I     :«i/n'i :II,/I«'/"II :> S/H"
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY
happening, he calls for a check. The advantage ofthis method is obvious: the gamemaster can plan ahead and make sure that precog checks work with his adventure.
On the other hand, the player could feel left out if all the other players are calling for their own Power checks (secretly, of course, but he'll figure it out) and he can't. So, you should prob¬ably either call for checks fairly often or—gasp!
—	try to make them useful when they do come up.
PvnoKwests
This mental hotfoot is nice for clones who like open flames. Merely by thinking, the mu¬tant can cause flammable things to spontane¬ously combust.
There are two ways to figure the difficulty number or range ofthis power. The first way is the easiest: the gamemaster simply figures out how flammable the object targeted is and gives it a difficulty range. Paper is simple. Green leaves — sorry, "green shingles on brown poles"
—	are easy. Flesh (we knew you'd get around to that) is difficult.
Modifiers can also be given for targeting, range, and stress level. If the character wants to set a huge bonfire, or a tiny pinprick offlame, he is broadening or narrowing his power — in¬crease the difficulty level.
The other way to use pyrokinesis isn't actu¬ally more complicated, and probably a little less fun for the gamemaster (unless, of course, he is using the power). Have the mutant declare a damage value. That's the difficulty number ofthe Power check. Ifthe check succeeds, that damage is done to the target (it's an Energy (E) attack, by the way, and armor can sometimes help). Ifit fails, no damage is done.
RiGTNfRATfON
By using this power, wounded mutants can recover from any injury short of death within minutes — ifthey are lucky. The base difficulty ofthe Power check simple for one wound taken, plus one difficulty level per additional wound. So, if a character has taken four wounds, the difficulty of the Power check is tough.
When the character makes the Power check, he is trying to heal by regrowing damaged tissue. If he succeeds, he heals one level of wound. If he fails, he does not succeed. The mutant can continue trying to regenerate as long as he has Power left. Healing one wound takes from one to five minutes.
An unconscious mutant will automatically try to regenerate once a round until he succeeds or wakes up.
Teutcwests
The mutant can pick up, move, and manipulate objects with the power ofhis mind. Of course, clones don't have real powerful minds, so ...
The difficulty ofthe Power check is based on the character's carrying capacity and the gamemaster's evaluation ofthe situation. Lifting or moving an object with a mass equal to or less than the mutant's carrying capacity is normal or less. Moving anything with a greater mass is tough or greater.
Fine motor skills can be tough as well. Flipping a simple toggle switch would be easy, but hitting lots ofbuttons or squeezing off an accurate shot with a laser would be harder.
TeuPATHY
This power, most valued by the Psion secret society, allows a mutant to project his thoughts into a target's — or multiple targets' — mind. The difficulty level ofthe Power 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
check is easy, but can be increased (or even decreased) for very complex (or very simple) messages. If the player can say his message clearly and understandably in five seconds, the difficulty should be easy. Otherwise, the telepathic connection is hard to establish.
The telepathic link can actually last for one to five minutes (random determination by the gamemaster) but, because of the primitive nature of this power, communication is usually in short bursts. However, because the mind is faster than the tongue (supposedly), more can be said and understood in that time. That's why the difficulty level can increase.
Also, range is a factor. Ifthe telepath can clearly see the target — even over a monitor —the difficulty is unmodified. Ifthe telepath can, and does, touch the target, the difficulty should actually be lower. If the target cannot clearly see the target, or cannot see the target at all, the difficulty level should be increased dramatically.
The target, for his part, can only respond in very brief (one second) replies, unless he has telepathy as well. The target can attempt to make a Chutzpah or perception roll to determine who is talking to him mentally, but the chances of success are almost always slim.
TeuPORr
A dangerous power, teleport is also very useful for getting out of a nasty scrape. The mutant concentrates for a full round (doing nothing else) and then makes a Power check. If he succeeds, he disappears. If he fails, he stays where he is (usually).
The base difficulty range for a teleport attempt is Normal. If the range of the actual teleport is very far (more than a kilometer), the difficulty can be increased. Ifthe mutant cannot see his destination clearly (monitors and vids count), then the difficulty should be increased. Ifthe clone is carrying lots of stuff— or another clone — the difficulty will jump dramatically.
There is an additional wrinkle to the teleport power. If a mutant with this power is in a battle or a very stressful situation and is knocked unconscious, have him make a Power check. Ifhe succeeds, he involuntarily teleports to a random location ofthe gamemaster's choosing — though it should be someplace the mutant would think of as "safe."
X-RAV l/fS/OM
The mutant can see through stuff, due to strange, inexplicable organs and membranes in his ocular structure. For reasons too complicated to go into, the mutant can see as clearly through clothing, walls, or floors as easily as you or I can see through smoke or fog.
The difficulty level of an x-ray attempt is easy, but that is modified by any substance thicker or more dense than clothing. Plastic, plasticrete, steel, titanium . . . they are all progressively more difficult to see through. Thickness counts as well.
If the character succeeds, he can see immediately beyond the obstruction (usually about ten meters or so), but not much farther. He can make perception checks as normal, for the one to five minute duration ofthe power. Ifthe character tries to see through a more dense substance than his original Power check, he must make another check.

Just when you thought it was safe to finish reading about mutant powers ...
No, seriously (?), here are a few more things about mutant powers you can use to make them run better in your game.
OOA/T MAKE 7кш ReuABte
Hey, these are mutant powers, not super powers. They aren't reliable or predictable. They don't always work the same way twice and, even ifthe character makes the Power check successfully, they don't have to work the way he wanted them to.
For example, precognition could be a nightmare power for a gamemaster. Solve this by having the clone who over-uses the power overcome by visions, dreams, and premonitions that incapacitate him long enough for whatever surprise he was try ing to ruin to come off normally.
Mutant:Aaah, argh! I ... I'm coming out of it. I see, I see ... A giant robot! Oh, no! A giant robot is going to burst through that door and attack us!
Team Leader: (Desperately trying to regroup the remainder ofthe team and retreat.) No kidding, Sherl-O-CKK! It attacked the minute you went into your trance! How about trying something useful ... like throwing yourself in its line of fire?!
MUTAA/T POWERS 

 
Оол/ТШс 'w EMRYTHWG
When a character gains a mutant power, have them make a Power roll (as per the instructions in "Character Generation"). Ifhe fails, he doesn't even know he has a mutant power. If he succeeds, you can describe to him as much as you want about the mutant power he has. Remember, he probably hasn't used it much — except accidentally — and hell know very little.
Gamemaster: Okay, you have a mutant power.
Player: Great! What is it?
Gamemaster: Well, one day, you were sitting around the PLC Infrared cafeteria when somebody started pushing you around. Normally, you'd take the jerk's name and clone number and "get back to him later," but you weren't in the mood to be devious. Something snapped. The next thing you knew, you were standing alone in the cafeteria, surrounded by fires ...
Player: Cool! Pyrokinesis!
Gamemaster:... and there were trays and tables thrown all about like they were kindling ...
Player: All right! Telekinesis!
Gamemaster: ... You felt that everyone outside was really afraid ...
Player: Um, empathy? Mind probe?
Gamemaster: ... but, finally, you realized ...
Player: What? What?
Gamemaster: ... That extensive knowledge of mutant powers, even their names and general characteristics, is above your security clearance. Where did you learn all those different names for mutant abilities, Citizen?
Player: Gulp ... um ... heh ...
Gamemaster: Please report for termination, Citizen. Mark off a clone, and have a nice day.
Player: Yes, Computer. Sigh.
ACC/OENTS HAPPEN
Remember those optional rules about critical failures? Well, don'tjust reserve those for norm al actions — mutant powers are crying out for attention. You can have a lot offun making mutant powers go haywire, even when players don't roll a "1" on their Power checks. Don't be restricted to critical failures — any time a character uses a mutant power, he is open game.
But you don't want to get too predictable or overbearing. You want characters to use their mutant powers — they're treasonous, they're unpredictable, and they're in your control ... what more can you ask for?
Here are some examples of failure nastiness you can use until you get the feel of it:
Adrenaline Control: The character gets weaker; he gains with one stat and loses another (really strong, but really clumsy); or maybe he has a cardiac arrest.
Charm: The character stinks, becomes repulsive, or, at the very least, becomes almost unnoticeable.
Deep Probe: The information obtained is completely wrong; the character gets an excruciating headache and cannot concentrate; or the target gets a nasty headache or maybe even a brain hemorrhage.
Electroshock: Zzt! Feedback! Or a short circuit — sparks coming up over the clone's hair make it obvious something is wrong. Don't get near water.
Empathy: A totally inappropriate emotion comes to the fore, or maybe the mutant himself becomes consumed with the emotion.
Energy Field: A kinetic accelerator — ouch! Stuff going through the field increases in energy and damage.
Hypersenses: Sensory overload or complete dampening. Either way, the character loses complete control of his senses.
Levitation: Up, up and away! No altitude control — just start heading toward the ceiling and hope it's solid! Or maybe the clone becomes heavier and goes through the floor.
Machine Empathy: Machines become very upset, violent, orj ust perverse. Maybe the machine likes the character, but is so completely messed up that it continues to do exactly the wrong thing.
Matter Eater: Burp! An emetic! Or a choking seizure. Maybe the matter eater feels an uncontrollable urge to devour everything in sight for a few minutes. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
Mechanical Intuition: No ... I'm sure that goes here ... The mutant breaks orjust plain screws up whatever he is trying to work with. Then, of course, he immediately tries to demonstrate it to everyone within the area of effect... er, within the area.
Mental Blast: The character attacks everyone in the area, himself, or the most inappropriate target you can imagine. Go ahead, imagine.
Polymorphism: The clone keeps changing for the duration. Oh, sure, at first the clone looks like what he desired, but then he starts to morph. First a little, then a lot—the clone might not even notice it himself, but somebody else will ...
Precognition: The character gains visions from someone else's near future ... or past, or present. Can be really fun if the situation seems similar.
Pyrokinesis: I'm on fire! No, you're on fire! No, everybody’s on fire! Either the character starts lighting random fires, or imagining he has. Hey, the power's all in his mind anyway.
Regeneration: The power works normally ... at first. But then it starts to overwork, Maybe an extra arm, leg, foot, or miscellaneous appendage is growing out of the former wound.
Telekinesis: It's a poltergeist! The TK power starts working on its own, obeying the character's subconscious.
Telepathy: All the mutant's most treasonous thoughts and desires become public knowledge as he broadcasts uncontrollably.
Teleport: Icky. The character teleports, but ends up ... yuch ... inside something. Automatic death, so you might want to try the random location idea more often.
X-Ray Vision: The clone starts giving offx-rays in enormous quantities. It probably won't be noticed until somebody gets really sick — and maybe not even then — or until someone turns on a rad detector.
Dotft B£ AfRA/D Of Success
With all the nasty things that can happen to mutants when they use their powers, you might need to encourage them a little. You can do this in two major ways.
First, when someone gets an unusually high roll or makes a really intelligent use of their mutant power, make it work really, really well — better than expected. That mind blast does +5 damage or the TK attempt is really subtle and precise ... whatever seems appropriate.
The second way to "reward" a mutant is to ignore obvious uses ofmutant powers. When their teams start screaming bloody mutant treason and trying to point the finger at them, chop it off. Reward the mutant for being the only non-mutant in the group, and accuse them of petty jealousy ... no matter how damning the evidence.
Of course, when the mutant gets too confident, chop him off...

ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ... 
The Computer keeps close tabs on equipment. Some things can be bought, but the Computer casts a stern glance on would-be hoarders. In any event, few citizens have m any credits to spare, and regulations narrowly restrict items to security clearance. Most equipment is assigned, on a temporary or long-term basis, to citizens. Some is treasonously
owned.
Those are, in fact, the three categories ofequipment ownership in Paranoia: personal, assigned and treasonous.
PERSONAL EQWPMENT
A citizen obtains personal equipment by paying for it or having it "indefinitely assigned" to him by the Computer. He can use and abuse it as he wishes — he can eat it, burn it, jump up and down on it — the Computer doesn't care, as long as no treason is committed.
ASS/GNED EQt/fPMENT
This equipment is assigned by the Computer, usually for a specific purpose. Assign¬ment can be on a short-term basis (perhaps for the duration of a single mission) or on a long-term one (like the laser each citizen is assigned when he becomes a Troubleshooter). Assigned equipment is, naturally, Computer property, and losing, damaging or destroy¬ing it is treason.
The citizen to whom the equipment is assigned is personally responsible for maintain¬ing and protecting it. Should he permit it to come to harm, he would, naturally, be a traitor. Since accidents do happen, the Computer does not invariably execute citizens who permit equipment assigned to them to come to harm—punitive fines (and treason points) are more common. Still, repeated carelessness, or the loss ofparticularly valuable items, could make the Computer call for the ultimate penalty.
There are two types of assigned equipment: standard and experimental.
STAA/DARD EQUfPMfMT
All equipment in this chapter, unless otherwise noted, is standard equipment. Standard equipment may have a security clearance (no one of lesser clearance may use or even touch it), but its existence is common knowledge throughout Alpha Complex, and it is probably fairly well tested and as bug-free as the Computer's equipment ever gets.
EXP€R/M£MTAI Еашрмемт
Experimental equipment is a special class of assigned equipment. "Experimental" includes any item that is currently under development or being studied by R&D (and includes both "experimental" and "really experimental" weapons and devices). Because
/43 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
testing experimental equipment is dangerous, it is assigned only on a voluntary basis.
Just as with all assigned equipment, the citizen to whom experimental equipment is assigned is responsible for it. Being responsible for experimental equipment can be unhealthy, because experimental equipment malfunctions, often spectacularly, with alarming frequency. Ifa malfunction can be shown to be the fault of R&D, the responsible citizen may avoid fines or charges of treason. But don't expect the geeks at R&D to just go along with taking the blame ...
TREASONOUS iQWPMENT
"Treasonous" equipment may be obtained in many ways. It may be available from secret societies. It may consist of undeclared items discovered on a mission. It may be stolen. It may be secretly looted from a dead colleague. All equipment that isn't personal or assigned is treasonous.
Failure to report and surrender all treasonous equipment is treason. If a citizen is discovered in possession of treasonous equipment, he receives one or more treason points, depending on the value of the item and how much of a threat it is to the security of Alpha Complex. Treasonous possession of expensive shoes might earn only one treason point, while treasonous possession of a tactical nuclear weapon might earn twenty or more. Note, however, that the higher a citizen's security clearance, the more likely the Computer is to ignore treasonous equipment. Rank hath its privileges, and the Computer does not begrudge a few special possessions to those whose loyalty to the Computer is proven.
И/НАТ fs TREASONOUS, ANYWAY?
So what makes equipment treasonous? Are there particular types of equipment that are treasonous?
Yes and no. There are really two possible reasons equipment might be treasonous.
The first is "the law of possession." If a character possesses equipment that has a security clearance above his own, and he does not have a special Computer-awarded brevet or clearance to carry it, the equipment is treasonous. Also, if a character has a piece of equipment he was not given, did not pay for, or was not assigned — guess
what... it's treasonous.
The second reason is "the Computer says so." The Computer might say that certain pieces of equipment are inherently treasonous, or treasonous in the possession of clones of any clearance. A manual on computer programming or Communist propaganda would
be treasonous, or an electromagnet powerful enough to erase Computer node information would be treasonous.
The Computer might alsojust decide that certain pieces of equipment are treasonous because he says so. There's probably a good reason at the base ofit, but the Troubleshoot¬ers don't need to know. For example, even though a Troubleshooter maxim is "Keep Your Lasers Handy," the Computer might decide that, for todaycycle, possession or use of lasers is treason. Why? Maybe there are a bunch of really powerful lasers circulating through Alpha Complex, and the Computer wants everyone to turn theirs in so It can check them all. But It isn't ——-	going to tell anyclone.
This is useful for gamemasters who want to throw players for a loop. It also works to "weed out" equipment that Trouble¬shooters have accumulated through their own deviousness.
AVA/IABHJTY
The sections that follow describe many varieties of equipment. However, not all are necessarily available at any time. There are limited quantities of each item in Alpha Complex, and they are rationed on a security clearance basis — a bunch of Red level Troubleshooters are well down on the food chain. Certain sophisticated devices are no longer manufactured in Alpha Complex, and some are manufactured infre¬quently and at great expense (robots, most vehicles and high technol¬ogy gear). That technology gap again.
As gamemaster, you can always refuse a request for equipment because it is not currently available, and you can assign woefully inadequate or inappropriate equipment to a mission because of the current unavailability of the proper equipment. Further, 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
you may decide that more sophisticated models are still experimental, and available only for experimental assignment (with the attendant risk of equipment failure).
Of course the list of available equipment is not expected to be exhaustive. Don't hesitate to add your own items, or delete ones you dislike. Don't be too fussy about prices or security clearances. If the players ask for something reasonable, be accommodating.
On the other hand, don't hesitate to refuse even the most reasonable requests. It's a crazy Complex. Sometimes things get lost. Sometimes things get broken. Sometimes the inventory gets confused. Sometimes the Computer gets confused. (Whooops, did I say that? The Computer never gets confused, Citizen!) Sometimes you can't even get a laser barrel. Or a case ofroom fresheners gets mistakenly labelled "grenades."
The Personal Equipment Chart (at the end of this chapter) lists all equipment which Troubleshooters may purchase themselves with their own credits. It also lists a security clearance for each piece of equipment; that clearance is the security clearance at which the equipment becomes available. At the indicated clearance, the Troubleshooter will receive the equipment if he asks nicely and can pay for it. At any lower clearance, his request will be refused.
However, the chart itself is Ultraviolet clearance. The Troubleshooters themselves are never told what equipment is available at their clearance. The only way to find out is to ask.
The Miscellaneous Equipment Chart lists equipment that Troubleshooters can never purchase, that can only be assigned to them. Nonetheless, credit costs and security clearances are included. The listed cost is the suggested fine for loss or damage to the indicated item, or an indication of the price a clone might be able to buy the item on the Infrared market. The security clearance is the level at which a Troubleshooter can requisition the item with a reasonable expectation of his request being granted. When equipment is requisitioned in this way, a character must explain why he needs the item and must sign documents accepting responsibility for it. His request may be refused ifthe Computer doesn't think he needs it, ifgamemaster characters have already scarfed them all up, or ifthe month has an "R" in it. (This chart, of course, is also Ultraviolet clearance. Surprised?)
WEAPONS
Dying repeatedly can sometimes get dull. That's why you need to give the player characters lots of exciting, fun, entertaining, unusual and different ways to die.
Weapons in Alpha Complex are deadly—to their users as well as their targets. Basically, the citizens who work in Alpha Complex's automated factories turning out mass-produced weapons are more concerned with fulfilling their quotas than with quality. As a result, even the most reliable weapons malfunction with alarming frequency.
You can have weapons malfunction whenever you like — when things are moving too slowly, for example, or when a weapon's failure will add zest to the atmosphere. Usually, weapons malfunction on a die roll of 1.
Each weapon, of course, malfunctions in its own charming way. Moreover the user of a weapon usually has one chance to try to remedy the malfunction before it proves deadly — by making a weapons skill roll. The descriptions below say how weapons malfunction, and what happens when a user tries to "remedy" the problem.
WEAPON TVPES ~
Different weapons kill you in different ways. Lasers puncture you with beams of coherent light, flamethrowers cover you with burning gunk, and grenades send lots of little jagged pieces of metal through you. While the distinction at first might seem unimportant—dead is dead, right? — some armor protects against certain forms of damage and not others. So it's helpful to know what kind of damage weapons inflict upon you. Weapons are divided into "types" according to the damage they do:
Laser W eapons (L): These send beams of coherent light through you. Shiny, mirrored surfaces provide some protection, as does armor reflecting light of the same color as the laser's beam.
Projectile Weapons (P): These send pieces of metal, plastic, ice or other hard substances through you. To offer protection against projectiles, armor has to be able to withstand high impact over a small surface area. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
Armor Piercing Weapons (AP): A lot like projectile weapons, except that these punch through armor better. The actual damage type is P, but divide all armor and Macho bonuses in half.
Energy Weapons (E): These shoot beams of electrons or other high-tech molecular junk at you. As you might expect, only high-tech armor protects against this stuff. Flamethrowers are also energy weapons — unless your armor has a coolant system, you're cooked.
Field Weapons (FP, FE, FL): These attack areas, not specific points (eg., flamethrowers cover you with flames). Armor must cover you entirely to protect you against these things. A character wearing, say, a kevlar vest (P3), would not be protected against a FP attack.
Bludgeoning or Impact Weapons (B): These crush you or cut you. Stuff like plate mail or lots of heavy sweaters protects you from impact damage.
STANDARD LASER WEAPONS
There are two types ofpersonal laser weapons: the laser pistol and the laser rifle. Both work the same way. A laser weapon's barrel can be unscrewed and removed from the main body ofthe gun, then replaced with another barrel. Replacing a barrel takes one combat round, during which time the user can take no other action. Each barrel may be fired with reasonable safety up to six times. If fired more than six times, there is an increasing chance of malfunction each time.
Each laser barrel can shoot a beam of only one color ofthe security clearance spectrum. The main body of a laser weapon can be mounted with a barrel of any color (although possessing a barrel that shoots a beam of higher clearance than your own is treason). Reflec armor is designed to reflect all laser fire of its wearer's color and below. Laser weapons of any type do "L" damage. They also require the laser weapons skill or Dexterity to operate.
Traditionally, each laser barrel is manufactured with six rings around the snout, each the same color as the barrel's beam. Each time the weapon is fired, one ofthe rings changes color. A glance at the weapon reveals how many shots remain, and the barrel's color.
Malfunction: If a laser pistol or rifle malfunctions, it emits a high-pitched beeping sound. Within a few combat rounds (roll the die, halve the number rolled, roundingdown, to determine how many), it explodes. The explosion is a "P5" attack in a five meter radius.
Remedy: A successful weapon (laser pistol, laser rifle) skill check against a BDR of normal prevents the explosion, but the weapon is unusable thereafter.
There are also vehicle-mounted or "field" laser weapons in Alpha Complex's arsenal They work in exactly the same way as personal laser weapons, except they are usually powered by larger energy packs and require use ofthe field weapons skill to fire. They are discussed further under "Field Weapons," below.
STANDARD PROJECT/IE WEAPONS
Projectile weapons fire large or small projectiles. Some are personal weapons, other are field weapons. They are very effective, if somewhat loud and messy. All projectile weapons do "P" damage unless otherwise noted. All projectile weapons require the projectile weaponi skill or Dexterity to fire.
StV6THftO№ftS AA/O Cow R/fUS
Slugthrowers are a development ofthe Old Reckoning handgun, semi-automatic rifle, and SMG. Cone rifles are neither cone-shaped nor rifles, but an offshoot of the modern bazooka. Both can fire a variety of different shells. Ammunition for both weapons is available in these forms:
t46 
•	Solid slugs are solid metal slugs which do damage by impact.
•	Dum-dums are solid slugs designed to fly apart upon impact. Dum-dum shells have lower range than solid slugs, but do more damage.
•	HE or high explosive shells explode on contact. For slugthrowers, these are explosive bullets, which do more damage than solid shells or dum-dums; for cone rifles, these are explosive shells which can affect a five meter radius.
•	AP or armor piercing shells are designed to penetrate armor. For slugthrowers, these are "greased" bullets designed to penetrate kevlar or other body armor. For cone rifles, these are explosive shells designed to penetrate tank or flybot armor. AP weapons do "P" damage, but they halve the armor they hit.
•	HEAP or high explosive armor-piercing shells are similar to AP shells, but are somewhat more effective (and costly). HEAP weapons do "E" damage and halve the armor value of the target, unless it is also AP resistant.
•	Napalm shells are designed to explode on contact, spreadingjellied petroleum or white phosphorus over the skin of the target (or, in the case of cone rifle shells, over the surrounding area). Napalm continues to burn for some rounds after contact (roll the die to determine how many), doing damage to the target each round. Since both jellied petroleum and white phosphorus contain their own supply of oxygen, napalm cannot be extinguished with water or by suffocation, but can only be removed by scraping the stuff off the skin. These weapons do "E" damage.
•	Flare shells are designed to illuminate rather than cause injury. Flare shells fired by slugthrowers are tracer bullets — they produce streaks of light which light up the area with in the radius listed on the Weapon Chart. Flare shells fired by cone rifles light up the
area indicated on the Weapon Chart, and continue to burn
for several

rounds after launch (roll the die and divide by 2 to determine how many). They can do damage to a target ifthey do hit someone — "P" damage from the impact and penetration.
•	ECM shells contain electronic jamming equipment. Only bot targets are affected by ECM. Additionally, radio, radar, and other devices which rely on the broadcast or reception of electromagnetic signals become inoperative. The shell's radius of effect is listed on the Weapon Chart. The type of damage is "E," but they only affect mechanicals.
•	Tacnuke shells are available only for cone rifles. They are small nuclear devices and can be quite devastating. This is a big "E."
•	Gas shells spread a cloud of gas over the radius indicated on the Weapons Chart. The
effect of gas depends on the specific type used:
Poison gas does damage to any living being within the gas radius. Roll for damage for each such being; treat it as an "E3" attack.
Smoke reduces visibility and scatters laser fire. When a character fires any weapon at a target visible through smoke, halve his skill number. In addition, treat the smoke as LI armor when laser fire is directed through it.
Corrosion gas does damage to all metallic beings (i.e., bots) within the area ofthe gas. Treat as poison gas, but it affects only inorganic and not organic beings. It also reduces the damage protection abilities ofmetal armor (e.g., plate); reduce the armor rating by 1 for each round the armor is exposed to the gas.
Vomit gas causes organic beings in the area ofthe gas to vomit. Each round, each being must make an endurance roll. Ifhe fails, he begins to vomit, and may take no other action for several combat rounds (roll the die and halve the number to determine how many).
Gauss gas is a substance which dramatically increases the permittivity of free space within the area of the gas cloud (and our thanks to Citizen Nxt-G-ENN for the meaningless techno-babble). Ifa gauss or energy weapon is fired into the area ofthe cloud and hits its target, add 3 to the damage value.
Dirt gas rapidly adheres to any solid substance, coating it with black slime. Apart from being disgusting, this reduces the damage protection from reflec armor. Reflec coated with dirt gas is only L2 armor. It returns to L4 if the wearer gets a chance to clean his armor. It takes two rounds and a plentiful supply ofwater or other solvent to clean armor.
Hallucinogenic gas contains a potent hallucinogenic drug. Each combat round a human remains in the gas cloud, he must make an endurance roll; if he fails, the hallucinogenic gas begins to take effect. All skill numbers are halved for the next day cycle because the human cannot be sure whether anything is real or imaginary.
Note: Non-organic beings (e.g., bots) are not affected by poison, vomit ofhallucinogenic gas. Characters wearing gas masks are similarly immune to these gases, as are characters in environment and combat suits.

Cone rifle shells are usually equipped with contact fuses, which explode upon impact, but other types of fuses are also available. (All slugthrower ammunition uses contact fuses.) Any type of shell may be equipped with any type of fuse. Other fuse types are:
• HEAP fuses activate a shell when it gets hot. How hot is hot? That varies from shell to
f48 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
shell — some activate at 30° Celsius, some at 100 degrees, some the moment they feel body heat, some only in the midst of a thermonuclear explosion. When a character requisitions a shell with a heat trigger, he should specify the heat level he wants, and pray that PLC doesn't screw up.
•	Gauss fuses activate when subject to violent electromagnetic flux. This flux can be caused by gauss or energy weapons, powerful radio signals, lightning, etc.
•	Remote fuses are designed to activate upon reception of a coded radio signal. They are usually used with com units modified to transmit the appropriate code. The user fires the shell, lets it fall, and waits. When he wants to activate the shell, he transmits the code. If the remote fuse is in an area blanketed by ECM jamming, it will not activate.
•	Timers activate a certain amount of time after being fired. How much time? Like heat fuses, this varies, from nanoseconds to geological epoches. Again, a character can try to specify when he requisitions a timer. T imers which can be set by hand prior to being fired are also available, but are rarer than pre-set timers.
Malfunction: The slugthrower or cone rifle jams. Ifthe weapon was firing any kind of shell other than solid slug or dum-dums, the shell explodes in the weapon's chamber, destroying it and doing damage as indicated by the Weapons Chart. The shell also has whatever effects such shells normally have (e.g., flare shells emit light).
Remedy: A successful projectile weapons check against a BDR of normal clears the jam. If the shell fired was solid slug or dum-dum, this returns the weapon to normal function. Otherwise, the weapon is a total loss.
STANDARD Mrsstu AND Meue WEAPONS
GRFA/ADF
This is, like, a grenade. You throw it, see? Usually, a clone can throw a grenade a maximum distance equal to his HTH damage times four in meters with no modifiers. After that, assign range modifiers as you see fit. They do "P" damage. Requires Agility or thrown weapons to use.
Malfunction: The grenade is a dud and fails to explode.
Remedy: No remedy is possible.
UHARMiD
Bare fists. These don't malfunction. Much. They do "B" damage equal to the character's HTH damage modified, as is all damage, by a+1d10 roll. You do "B" damage. Brawling is used to hit.
BRASS KMUCKUS
Like the name says, although brass is rare in Alpha Complex—these are more likely to be made of steel or aluminum.. They don't malfunction particu¬larly, either. They enhance a character's HTH "B" damage. Even though these are, technically, melee weapons, you use brawling to hit with them.
KMFB, CLUB, SWORD, TRMWOU
Do you really need definitions ofthese? You do? Where is Citizen Web-B-STR when we need him? They do "B" damage. You use — duh — melee weapons to attack with a melee weapon (what a surprise).
Malfunction: It breaks.
Remedy: There ain't none. Oh, you can take it home and fix it up with some superglue, I suppose.

Mil/ROWHfP
A nasty whip-shaped weapon which delivers a stinging jolt to the nervous system. A melee weapon that does "E" damage. You can also use the tangler Hit Location chart (below) to determine what part of a victim gets caught by the weapon on an astounding success (die roll of20) ifyou want. The character would then automatically take damage every round until unlashed.
Malfunction: Lashes back and forth and hits its wielder; roll damage for him as ifhe were a target.
Remedy: None (the weapon didn't break; the userjust screwed up).
fORC£ SWORO
This weapon is a monofilament fiber encased in a force field sheath. It can cut through just about anything short of neutronium. It does "E" damage and is aforce weapon. Rumor has it there are force knives and force axes out there as well, but we all know that rumors are treason.
Malfunction: The force field ceases to exist, and the monofilament becomes a loose wire which may whip around and injure its user. In this case, the user makes a skill roll; ifhe succeeds, he avoids injury. Ifhe fails, he rolls for damage as a target.
Remedy: Nothing can prevent the malfunction. A successful weapons roll returns the weapon to normal function.
£хреыме*гт HARO WCAPORS
The following hand weapons are experimental. Each is accompanied by a security clearance. This is the usual security clearance ofthe weapon, though it can go up or down as you see fit.
SOR/C WiAPOHS
Orange. Sonic pistols and rifles are experimental weapons which project a cone of deadly ultrasonic vibrations. They do "E" damage.
Malfunction: The weapon shakes itselfto pieces, doing damage to its wielder. Roll on the Damage Table; treat it as an "E4" attack.
Remedy: No remedy is possible.
fee GURS
Red. Ice guns operate by freezing water and rapid-firing needles of ice. They are reloaded by pouring water into a nozzle at the top ofthe weapon. Ice guns do "E" damage.
Malfunction: The freezing chamberjams and over-freezes. Roll the die; ifthe number
If odd, the gun shatters, spraying the wielder with shards ofice. Roll on the Damage Table; treat it as a "P8" attack.
Remedy: A successful energy weapons skill roll versus a BDR of normal prevents the ice gun from shattering, but the weapon cannot be repaired.
BlASTeRS ARO £R£RGV PfSTOtS
Orange. The principles by which the blaster and energy rifles and pistols work are so secret that virtually no one knows them. The blaster is a large (.6 meter) weapon fired with one hand which has flashy fins and is styled like a Corvette; the energy pistol is much smaller and exists in an antenna sur¬rounded by rings. Both types do "E" damage.
Malfunction: Roll the die. On an even roll, the weapon stops working. On an odd 

 
roll, it heats up suddenly, then vaporizes. In the latter case, the holder suffers damage; roll on the Damage Table — treat it as an "E8" attack.
Remedy: A normal energy weapons skill roll prevents vaporization, but the weapon is useless.
Meeou GUMS
Yellow. Needle guns look much like modern automatic hand guns, but appear to be made ofplastic. When the user presses a button on the handle, a door opens to reveal a roll of tiny plastic flechettes. The weapon is reloaded by removing the spool on which this roll is mounted and replacing it with a new one (much like replacing it a printer ribbon). When fired, the weapon separates the flechettes and fires them in a steady stream. These weapons do "AP" damage.
Malfunction: The plastic ammunition jams in the pressure chamber and the weapon may explode. Roll the die. On an even roll, the weapon is unusable. On an odd roll, it explodes. In this case, roll for all beings with one meter on the Damage Table (treat it as an "AP9" attack).
Remedy: A successful projectile weapons skill roll clears the j am and prevent an explosion, but the weapon malfunction number increases by 1 (to 2) whenever fired thereafter.	' 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
Malfunction: All beings within five meters are stunned (roll as above to determine the number of rounds).
Remedy: A successful Normal energy weapons skill roll repairs the weapon. If a A TRAfTOR OCMONSTRATfS character attempts to repair the weapon and fails, he is knocked unconscious and the PROPER VSR Of THf TM6l£R, weapon is permanently busted.
TANGURS
Green. A tangler throws a four meter adhesive rope, which wraps it¬self around the target and gradually contracts. It does no damage, but gradu-ally contracts. It does no damage, but when a target is hit, the gamem aster rolls on the Hit Location T able (below) to determine the body location to which the tangler rope adheres. Ifthe head is hit, the rope is assumed to have wrapped around the target's neck, and the target will die of strangulation in several rounds (roll the die to deter¬mine how many) unless the rope is removed. The victim needs the aid of another to remove it, but this takes only one round. If any other body loca¬tion is hit, that area is immobilized and the target loses its use. Again, he may remove the rope in one round with the aid of another.
Remedy: A successful normal energy weapons skill fixes it. An unsuccessful roll means all the adhesive ropes burst out and stick to the character attempting the repair.
GAUSS GUNS
Indigo. Gauss guns project a violent electromagnetic flux which wreaks havoc on bots and electronic equipment. Organic beings do not suffer damage from gauss guns. Against bots, figure this as "E" damage.
Malfunction: If the weapon malfunctions, it stops working — no other ill effects.
Remedy: A successful normal electronic engineering roll fixes the weapons.
PLASMA G£N€RATOR
Violet. A plasma generator consists of a tank backpack which contains plasma held in a magnetic bottle, a magnetically-sealed hose which leads from the backpack to a hand projector, and a shield which protects the wielder from the hand projector. When fired, a ball of plasma (superheated gas) is emitted from the hand projector, and travels forward from the wielder, expanding as it moves. Each combat round, the ball moves five meters forward, though its movement may be affected by wind. It expands outward in a 60 degree cone in front of the wielder, doing damage to anything in that cone as it moves. It continues moving for four rounds, then dissipates.
Note: If a player fires the ball into the wind, it may be blown back into his face. Regardless, it does "E" damage.
Malfunction: A warning alarm buzzes. After several combat rounds (roll the die and halve the number rolled to determine how many), the weapon explodes. Roll for all beings with 10 meters on the Damage Table (treat as an "E20" attack).
Remedy: This is a tough one. The weapon is very expensive, and the Computer will be very displeased if it is damaged. On the other hand, a character may understandably prefer to run. A successful easy energy weapons skill roll turns off the buzzer. A second successful roll (normal) prevents the weapon from exploding. A third (tough) roll would repair the weapon and return it to normal function — good luck!
By the way — if the magnetic containment bottle is ever hit by laser fire, the plasma generator is not long for this world.

ARMOR
There are several different types of armor in Alpha Complex, though all of them are rare. See, only clones involved in Computer missions that require constant fighting—like Armed Forces types, certain IntSec units, and Computer guards — are assigned armor on a permanent basis. Everyone else is supposed to "Keep Their Lasers Handy," but only use them on Computer command. Even Troubleshooters are only assigned armor on really dangerous missions.
But armor is very, very useful. Most is not prone to malfunction, and it is the only thing out there between your enemies, your Macho stat, and your hide.
All armor is designated by a letter, or series ofletters, followed by a number or series ofnumbers. For example, reflec armor is "L4"—it protects against laser damage to a value of four points. This is all explained in more detail in the Combat chapter.
ARMOR 7Vpes
Armor types coincide with weapon types. Each type of armor is specifically designed to deflect a certain type of attacks. Really great armor deflects more than one type of attack. Here are the basic kinds of armor that exist in Alpha Complex:
Laser Armor (L): Mostly reflec armor, laser armor reflects or partially blocks the damage caused by lasers. Most laser armor only deflects damage from certain security clearances of laser. If so, the armor will be listed first by its security clearance, then by the damage it reflects. Example: Red reflec (L4).
Projectile Armor (P): A variety ofarmor types blunt the penetration of"P" damage. They are usually rigid or thick armor types.
AP-Resistant Armor (AP): Armor piercing weapons halve the protection of normal "P" armor, but AP armor is super-resistant to penetration. Double the armor value of AP armor versus "P" damage, and do not halve the value versus "AP" damage. Example: Laced Kevlar (AP4) actually has an armor value of 8 versus "P" damage and a 4 versus "AP" damage.
Energy Armor (E): Sometimes actually using energy to deflect energy, more often just cutting down on radiation absorption, energy armor is useful against those nasty blasters and energy weapons Commies continuously seem to get hold of.
Field Armor (FP, FE, FL): Field weapons attack areas, not people — and in a more complete way than grenades or cone rifle shells do. They are huge. It is a rare armor that can resist the damage caused by a field weapon. Those armor types are noted by the designation "F" before the type of damage they resist. Field armor is also good against normal damage. So, if you have "FP4" armor, it will provide armor value 4 against FP weapons and against normal "P" damage weapons.
Impact Resistant Armor (B): Bludgeoning weapons do damage by direct force. Impact resistant armor cushions and deflects those attacks.
All Armor (ALL): Some armor protects equally against all normal types of attacks. Ifyou have "ALL" armor, you can use its armor value against any type of attack. However, "ALL" armor does not protect against field weapons (that would be "FALL" armor) and its armor value is halved versus "AP" damage (unless it is "APALL"). 

 

 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
RETLEC ARMOR
Reflec armor defends against laser "L" armor. It will cause laser fire to be partially, or completely, deflected. It can be worn over other light armor (gamemaster's discretion), but wearing anything over reflec cuts its value ofprotection in half. Getting it really dirty has the same effect.
Note: Reflec armor is always colored its security clearance and will only deflect laser attacks that are of its clearance or lower.
KEVLAR
Excellent light protection against projectiles, kevlar armor is "P" resistant. It is light and flexible, and often assigned to lower clearance Troubleshooters.
iACiO KEVLAR
A much rarer version of kevlar, laced kevlar is "laced" with super-strong fibers that give the armor AP protection. It is only handed out to higher clearance clones or Troubleshooters on really important Computer missions. It is visually undistinguishable from regular kevlar.
LEATHER
Leather armor went out with the Old Reckoning (or maybe before), but syntheleather is popular among certain clones. Expensive, and usually only available to clones of Orange clearance or above, it is the best personal armor a clone can by — since it is more of a fashion statement than a protection. It protects against "B" attacks only.
CHA/H
Armor bordering on the treasonous (wearing it is like saying, "Hey, I have Old Reckoning knowledge!"), it is rarely worn in Alpha Complex, but careful clones can get away with it — and it protects better against "B" damage than leather.
PLATT
Many security guards and Corpore Metallica secret society members go in for plate armor. It is usually made up of scavenged bot armor or pieces of dome shielding, but the Computer has issued actual plate armor suits. Bulky and heavy, it protects very well against "B" damage.
ASBESTOS CLOTHWG OR Svrr
A very specialized type of armor, the Computer only lets this stuff out to clones likely to be encountering, well, open flame. Reactor personnel and PLC cooks can get it on request, others may have to wait. Asbestos clothing is good versus "E" damage, while a full suit protects against "FE" damage (since it covers the entire body completely.
fARRADAV 3UfT
A more advanced, and much harder to get, version of asbestos clothing comes in the form ofthe Farraday suit. It is equipped with internal cooling mechanisms and radiation¬damping layers. Only high clearance Power Services and PLC (Food Vat detail) can hope
to lay their hands on this stuff, un¬less the Computer has something special in mind. It protects against "FE" damage.
fA/VLROA/MEATT SVfT
There are places in Alpha Com¬plex where the air is so poisonous, corrosive, or just plain nasty that even the Computer won't send many clones in without an EV suit. It pro¬tects against ALL damage, and al¬most all EV suits are coated against corrosive gasses and contain their own breathing apparatus.

The Five Laws are enforced by asimov circuits. Some bots' asimov circuits are faulty or have been removed; they may operate treasonously, i.e., disobey Computer or human orders. These bots are said to have gone frankenstein, roughly the robotic equivalent of treason.
Many bots resent and fear humans because ofthe immense power they have over bots. These bots frequently interpret human commands in the most annoyingly counterproduc¬tive manner possible; it is wise to be extremely careful when wording orders to bots.
MEMORY /WO MEM CAROS
Each bot has a certain amount ofresident memory, expressed in memory sectors. One memory sector is enough memory for a bot to have a skill at level 1. Twenty memory sectors could be filled with software for one skill at level 20, or twenty skills at level 1, or any other combination of skills.
Usually, software is loaded into a bot, and rarely changed. However, some bots are assigned mem cards. A mem card is a packet of chips, about the size ofa cassette, in which software is stored. The bot can plug the packet in (like loading a home video game), and load the software into its resident memory.
Each mem card contains software for a specific skill, at a specific level. For example, a card labelled "LaserWeapons 7" loads the bot with software, letting it fire laser weapons at skill level 7. If the bot doesn't have at least 7 memory sectors, it couldn't load the software. If it has 7 or more sectors, but all were already occupied by other software, it would have to erase some software to make room for the laser weapons software.
Note that while a mem card can give a bot knowledge of any skill, the bot's ability to use the skill is constrained by its physical makeup. Even ifa cranebot has a memcard with Medicine 15 software, the fact that its manipulatory digits are the size of station wagons might make it a little difficult for the bot to perform microsurgery.
By the way, it is completely untrue that PLC occasionally mislabels software packages. Itjust never happens that a bot is loaded with what Troubleshooters think is one skill, but turns out to be another one entirely. Never. Honest. Ignore that bot behind the curtain.
There is also absolutely no truth to the rumor that robots with severe personality dysfunctions can "infect" mem cards, passing the dysfunctions on to other bots who use the cards. Rumors are treason, Citizen.
Мем CARO ~PACKAGSS~
Often, to make certain that mem cards are not abused, PLC or the Computer will issue mem card "packages." These packages usually contain several skills each, but other directives as well. For example, a jackobot assigned to a dangerous mission might be equipped with a cone rifle, a laser weapon, and a mem card containing the appropriate skills. The Troubleshooters have to stick the mem card in when they want the jackobot to perform.

Docbots and Healing: As it says above, a docbot can repair a clone so well that he can get up from near death and operate efficiently. This is not just a by-product of over¬stimulation by drugs, right, Friend Citizen? You trust the docbot, don't you?
JACKOBOTS
Jackobots are all-purpose robots designed to do anything a human can. They stand about 1.5 meters tall; the transport module is a flexible, articulated chassis with two sets of soft plastic treads. On this chassis is mounted a turret-like cylinder roughly correspond¬ing to a human torso. On top of the cylinder is a cluster of sensors and communications equipment that corresponds to a human head in size and basic function. Two arms that mimic the function of human arms extend from the cylinder.
Jackobot brains have true intelligence, and therefore develop human-like personali¬ties. In addition, they have a large reprogrammable memory which permits the user to plug in mem cartridges. Thus, anyjackobot has potentially any skill, if it is supplied with the proper cartridge. Because of the memory limitations of individual models, only a certain number of skill programs can be resident in memory at any one time. However, a jackobot can reprogram itself within three combat rounds simply by unplugging one cartridge and inserting another (just like a home video game machine).
Jackobots are the most-commonly assigned bots on Troubleshooter missions. Often, it can be fun for the gamemaster to design ajackobot according to his own whims and keep it around for several missions. It is rumored that two Jackobots, whose names I can't remember right now, were the only survivors of nine very successful missions for the Computer, but it would be treason for me to say any more at this time. (Ask me again in a few yearcycles.)
OTHERS
Docbots and Jackobots are the robots most frequently encountered by player charac¬ters. Other include:
Scrubots: Small stupid bots mounted with rotary scrub-brushes and cleaning instru¬ments, these keep Alpha Complex clean.
Warbots: Death machines used by the Armed Forces in their interminable struggle against the Commies. Notoriously well-armed, and notoriously prone to faulty asimov circuits.
Combots and Guardbots: Less well-armed military bots.
Teachbots: These teach the children of Al¬pha Complex.
Flybots: Intelligence aircraft; see "Vehicles" below.
Petbots and Funbots: The less said the better.
Many others exist as well. Feel free to intro¬duce new bots at the drop of a hat. Or an anvil. Or the stock market. Or your blood pressure.
AssfGMWG Bor STATS
Bots only have the stats you need. Most
commonly, they consist of the following:
Armor: Most bots have "B" armor, though a few have "ALL." They are generally pretty tough, ranging from armor values around three for
puny scrubots to fifteen or higher for warbots.
Weapons: A bot can have as many weapons of any type that you want, though they are only assigned weapons if the Computer thinks they fit the bot's normal programming. Remember, however, that almost all bots are strong (HTH damage of at least three, up to twenty for

superbots) and have appendages that they can use as weapons (sure, you laugh off a scrubot's rotor brush with its damage ofHTH+2, but is the	»
docbot's surgical chainsaw, damage value Bll, that easy to ignore?)	'A
Wound Levels: Most bots can take at least three wounds before being disabled, the median being around five. Only military or huge bots (like transbots) can take more than ten wounds.
Skills/Programs: Give them whatever skills you want them to have, at whatever level. Most bots should only have very specific skills — some ofwhich you'll have to make up—with very specific applications, but others can have truly bizarre combina¬tions. You never know who has been programming them. Keep the restrictions above as guidelines (the Computer is always making breakthroughs).
COMS
Corns are sometimes issued as portable units to Troubleshooter teams (especially those visiting the Outdoors), and are often installed in vehicles.
Types of corns include:
Field Telephones: Two or more phones, a power source, and lengths of wire connecting them. Messages are transmitted along the wires, which can be buried beneath the surface (to hide the wires and to protect them from damage). Messages can be transmitted without breaking radio silence, but mobility is restricted by the wire.
The wire is also easily cut. Gauss weapons and_ECM devices disrupt any field telephone within 500 meters.
Shielded Field Telephones: These are identical to field telephones except that the wire is shielded from gauss and ECM effects.
Com I: These are like walkie-talkies. They can broadcast on five channels and have a range of about ten kilometers. A more powerful com can rebroadcast the signal of a com I, thus relaying it over a larger effective range. Inside Alpha Complex, signals may be blocked by walls, doors, ceiling, etc.
Com II: These unabridged dictionary-sized units are more powerful versions of the Com I. They can be tuned by the user to broadcast on any radio frequency. They can also scan the spectrum for broadcasts. Com II's have a range of 100 kilometers at short wavelengths, and a range to the horizon at longer wavelengths. Inside Alpha Complex, signals may be shielded by heavy metal objects.
Com III: These are even more powerful and have a virtually unlimited range. At shorter wavelengths, they can blanket the earth, while at longer wavelengths, they can reach to the horizon or line of sight. They are not portable, and are usually installed in vehicles (e.g., flybots). They are rarely used inside Alpha Complex, as their signals are strong enough to disrupt regular civilian communications.
Com IV: The ultimate in communication power. They can broadcast simultaneously on up to 100 different wavelengths. They have input j acks which permit various telemetry devices to be connected. For example, an electronic thermometer could be connected, and the unit would then broadcast a signal indicating the current temperature on a wave¬length chosen by the user. These units are most often installed in unmanned probes or in sophisticated robot units. Their transmission rate is extremely high, the equivalent of modern-day space probes.
STANDARD COMMUMCAT/OM PROCCDURCS
' When Outdoors, characters are required to remain in communication with Alpha Complex at all times. Failure to do so is treason (but more likely to result in treason points than actual execution). On long-range expeditions, each character or team is required to carry a Com II, unless the party is equipped with a flybot or other vehicle with a Com II, III or IV. In the latter case, characters carry Com I's; their transmissions are relayed to the Computer by a more powerful unit. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
Corns carried by characters transmit continually, so the Computer can monitor what goes on. Com units can be turned off, but a character who wishes to turn his com offmust first obtain permission from the Computer. If it is turned off without proper authoriza¬tion, he earns treason points. (Rumors that some com units explode violently ifturned off without prior Computer authorization are treason).
Мист/союш
Multicorders are all-purpose detection devices. Each is fitted with a variety of sensors. They are operated with the use ofmulticorder programs which come in the form of plastic cassettes. Programs permit the multicorders to process and display sensor data in various useful ways. There are four models of multicorders, increasing in sophistication as the model number rises. Some programs can only be used with the more sophisticated models.
Mooets
Multicorder I: This portable device is often carried on missions into the Outdoors, or as backup on other missions. Only one program may operate at any one time.
Multicorder II: This is available as a rather bulky portable model, and is often installed in vehicles. It can run three programs at one time.
Multicorder III: This is only installed in vehicles or large bots. Up to five programs may run at once.
Multicorder IV: This is the most powerful multicorder; it is only installed in vehicles or large bots. Up to ten programs may run at once.
MuiTfcORDCR PROGRAMS
Radar: Available in all models. Displays a variety of processed radar images in various scales. The effective range ofthe radar varies with multicorder number: model 1 — 1 km; model II — 10 km; model III — 100 km; model IV — 1000 km. (The maximum range is never greater than line-of-sight.)
Infrared: Available in all models. Displays a variety of processed infrared images in various degrees of magnification with overlays interpreting temperature levels. Hot areas appear brighter than cool areas. Animals and humans appear lighter than the surrounding terrain, while aj et's contrail would be distinctly brighter. The effective range varies with the model number: model I — 100 m; model II — 1 km; model III — 10 km; model IV — 10 km.
Radio/Radar: Displays a variety of processed images indicating the location ofradio/ radar emissions in the vicinity. Also serves as a radio receiver. Effective range varies with the model number: model I — 10 km; model II — 100 km; model III — 1000 km; model IV—5000km.
Visible Light: Operates like a video camera, with a variety of enhancements like magnification, image recognition, and filtering. This is used as the visual sensor element in most robots, permitting the robot to broadcast what he "sees" directly to his brain, an operator, monitor, or the Computer. Available for all units. Range is line of sight.
X-Ray: Available only for models I & II. Allows unit to be used as a portable x- ray machine, primarily for medical pur¬poses. Range — 3m.
Radioactivity: Displays graphic rep¬resentations of radioactivity levels and types ofradioactivity in the environment.
Translate: Available for all models. Each program permits basic translations
of one language into another. The more

sophisticated the multicorder, the more refined and reliable the translation. All models translate spoken language; model IV permits limited translation of printed material in :ertain languages.
Dead Reckoning: Available for all models. Stores and displays a variety ofmaps, or accesses map libraries via radio. When the program is running, the operator must input current position; thereafter, the unit will display the map on request with the current position, route and identified features on the map.
Lie Detector: Available for all models. The multicorder is connected to electrodes which are attached to the subject. The multicorder then interprets the subject's spoken and biochemical responses to a series of questions, indicating which of the subject's statements are true, false or ambiguous. The test is only partly reliable. (When a character attempts to lie while hooked up to a lie detector, roll against his Chutzpah.)
Psi Phenomena: Experimental. Detects and graphically displays psi activity in the environment. Presence of psi activity is detected with some reliability, but indication of direction and range of psi activity from unit is extremely unreliable. (Psi activity is defined as the use of any psionic mutant power.) Available only for models II, III and IV. Range varies with model number: model II — 0.25 m; model III — 0-100 m; model IV—0-1000 m.
Toxic Analysis: Identifies most ofthe more common toxic substances. Samples are placed in a small lab unit connected to the multicorder. Rarer and more subtle toxins may not be identified. Available for all models.
Life Form Recognition: Compares visual, x-ray, infrared and other data with library preferences to identify plant or animal forms. Provides a concise summary of significant facts about the life form and permits remote radio access to more complete reference libraries. Programs are available for various different ecological provinces; life forms not native to that province will probably not be identified properly. Available for all models.
Bot Damage Analysis: Runs a series of tests designed for each specific type and model of robot to determine nature and extent of any damage or malfunction.
Disease Analysis: Analyzes tissue and blood samples for foreign bacteria, viri, etc., as well as chemical imbalances, genetic disorders, and so forth. Standard installation on
many docbot models. Available for all models.
Recorder: Available for all models. May operate like a sound or video tape recorder, and can also record data, images, and interpretations from any other multicorder program. The recorder program is routinely loaded into the portable or vehicle-installed multicorder assigned to each Troubleshooter mission. The recorder program may thus provide a complete record of a party's activities. Often the data recorded is simultaneously broadcast directly to the Computer to permit it to monitor the mission's progress. It is a treasonous act to prevent the multicorder from maintaining a complete record of a mission's activities.
Self-Destruct: Loading this program into a multicorder causes the unit to wipe all currently loaded or recorded programs. The hardware is not damaged, but new program cassettes will be required before the multicorder can be used again.
MucTtcoRoeR ASS/GWENT
While there are many different types ofmulticorder, the only sure assignment on any Troubleshooter mission is the recorder. The Computer knows everything that goes on in Alpha Complex, but It likes to have Troubleshooters incriminate themselves. Often, what is not shown on a multicorder is often more damaging than what is.
Troubleshooter Olverst-O-NNE:... And so, as our film draws to a close, you can see that Troubleshooter Team "Dodo" executed all mission parameters with astounding precision and loyalty.
(A cheer goes up from the Troubleshooter team as they pat Olverst on the back.)
Computer: Very good film, Communications Officer. But, I wonder ifyou could explain this. (The lights dim again and the screen comes to life.) This film, taken by Team Dodo's docbot, seems to show a much different view of events. (The scene shifts, eliciting groans of dismay from several Troubleshooters.) Such as here, where you and the team Equipment Guy have the multicorder recorder open and you are cutting and splicing vidtape. How do you explain such wanton treason, Citizen?
Olverst-O-NNE: Ahh ... Creative interpretation and representation of historical events, blended with fictional actions and happenings that further enhance the Communication Officer's vision of empathy with the significance of the mission?

No citizen (legitimately) owns a vehicle as personal equipment (though an Ultraviolet clearance permits a commandeer any vehicle at will); vehicles are temporarily assigned to Troubleshooters according to the needs of each mission and the vehicles' availability. There are, however, many vehicles (like transtube transbots) that provide mass transpor¬tation for citizens within Alpha Complex.
ViHfCU OPiRATfOM
Any character can normally operate a vehicle on autopilot with the assistance of the Computer. Any character with operation and repair skill can operate a vehicle on manual drive.
Inadequately-skilled operators always manage to get themselves into some kind of trouble — frequently, fatal trouble. And even ifthey are fortunate enough to survive their mistakes, they are faced with the prospect of stifffines for damaging valuable equipment. Of course, this encourages Troubleshooters to be careful with their assigned vehicles. Unfortunately, being careful isn't always enough.
Each vehicle has a security clearance. A character of the same clearance or higher as the vehicle can access its users' manual, and find out how to operate it and all about its capabilities. In normal circumstances, only citizens of the appropriate clearance are assigned vehicles.
However, the Computer considers Troubleshooter missions ofthe utmost importance to Alpha Complex, and unstintingly assigns resources to Troubleshooter missions when needed. Frequently, Troubleshooters are assigned vehicles of much higher clearance — Blue, Indigo or Violet. These vehicles are extremely powerful, and often heavily armed. Unfortunately, the Troubleshooters do not have the requisite security clearance to access the users' manual, and the Computer is not about to permit such a drastic breach of regulations.
Trying to operate a vehicle with no knowledge of its capabilities can be frustrating:
Troubleshooter: Okay, I ease the flybot into gear.
Gamemaster: With a dramatic WHUMP, the steam cannon launches you out the tubes at Mach 3. Gone-R is sucked out his window by the slip stream.
Troubleshooter; I hit the "close windows" switch.	.
Gamemaster: Which switch is that?
Troubleshooter: Ah—the one by my armrest?
Gamemaster: Ah, the emergency eject. Another WHUMP; the explosive bolts fire and the doors and roof fly off... Did you have your seatbelt on?
Troubleshooter: What seatbelt?
Gamemaster: Aha. Your chair launches upward with tremendous velocity — you tumble out of it. You are thrust suddenly into a Mach 3 wind (rolls dice) — a wound. Okay, you're falling. Below you crazily tumbles a green-blue and brown object — it fills an entire hemisphere. Troubleshooter: The Earth?
Gamemaster: That's right. Nearby, you hear a third WHUMP — and a parachute opens. The empty chair descends slowly at the end of its chute. The green-blue and brown object is ap¬proaching rapidly. What do you do?
Troubleshooter: Spread my arms real wide?
Gamemaster: Right. Whammo. New clones. Briefing. Outfitting. R&D. Your clones are conducted to the Experimental Launch Station. The duty officer shakes his head sadly and says, "Sure hope you do better than that last bunch."
{Тешей Types
Crawler: These are tracked all-terrain vehicles used for missions in the Outdoors. They come in various sizes and designs. Some are specifically intended to carry personnel; some are for transporting raw materials from the Outdoors; some are armored and designed for military applications. They are relatively slow but can travel in extremely rough terrain and are reliable water craft in the calm waters of lakes and large rivers.
Autocar: This is the most common type ofvehicle inside Alpha Complex, correspond¬ing to modern personal cars, small trucks, and vans. They are "auto" cars in the sense that
/62 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
they may be slaved to automatic guidance systems that run beneath the surface of all thew roadways in Alpha Complex, but they may also be operated manually for unusual maneuvers or where the guidance systems are no longer maintained. They come in all shapes and sizes and are in relatively good supply.
Hover: This is a specialized variety of aircushion vehicle that was very popular in Old Reckoning times. It is still used in the Outdoors when missions permit using the ancient roadways. Hovers can also cross lakes and large rivers. They are capable of high speeds on good road surfaces and across calm water, but they are not safe in difficult terrain or rough water. They make poor combat ve¬hicles, since they bear little armor or arma-ment. Hovers come in various sizes, but the
four-to-six man version is most commonly used for Troubleshooter missions.
Copter: These are very similar to modern helicopters. Small, two-man models are relatively common. In addition to the equivalent of personnel carriers, transports, and gunships, there is also a small combat jet-copter capable of high speeds and agile maneuvers.
Flybots: This is a general term for a variety of aircraft designs that have one feature in common — robot guidance systems. Less sophisticated flybots have no more than elaborate autopilots and computer-assisted combat capabilities. More complex flybots are assigned to low-clearance Troubleshooters, since they often lack the skills and clearances to manually operate any other aircraft. The most serious problems in dealing with flybots have to do with the often quirky robot intelligences that guide them.
Transbot: This vehicle corresponds to the tractor-trailer/road transport systems of the modern world. Each transbot is controlled by a bot brain. Transbots can be manually guided by skilled operators along sections of roadway where the automatic guidance systems are no longer maintained or where they were never installed. Transbots can also be used on surface roads in the Outdoors (ifthe roads have not deteriorated significantly). Many transbots are not designed to carry passengers, but ingenious Troubleshooters and traitors manage to catch rides on transbots in the same way that bums used toj ump old- fashioned freight trains.
Transtubes: The transtube system in Alpha Complex is actually a mass transit system employing modified transbots as passenger trains. It is very efficient, very safe, and there are hardly ever accidents. Not even at the AMT/RAKjunction. No matter what you've heard.
Vulturecraft: This is a general term for a variety of combat and close support aircraft used by elite Vulture Squadrons ofthe Armed Forces. They represent the apex of Alpha Complex's military strength and are often equipped with the latest technology in weapons, sensors and guidance systems. Note: "Vulture Troopers" take their name from the Vulture Warrior fighter flybots, but seldom actually have any connection with the bots.

Have you ever been in a Chevrolet K car? The ones that talk? "A door is ajar. A door is ajar. Please fasten your seatbelt. Thank you." There's nothing more annoying.
It's bad enough to have an idiot voice nagging you over trivia; imagine how much worse things would be ifthe voice had intelligence and even control over the vehicle. That's about how things are in Alpha Complex; many vehicles, especially the most elaborate models frequently issued to Troubleshooters, are equipped with their own bot brains, e.g.,
Flybot: Please fasten your seat belt.

Flybot: Well, okay, ifyou insist. (Flybot turns.) (Time passes.)
Flybot: Shouldn't we climb a bit or something? Troubleshooter: Huh? Why? (Through the viewscreen looms a huge mountain, shrouded in mist.) Gulp. Why didn't you tell me we were headed into a mountain? (Wrenches at wheel.)
Flybot: You said "left turn," so I turned left. I suggested maybe we should do something else, but no. You were pretty rude about it, too. (Turns desperately; a wing spar snaps; wing begins to shudder; G-forces rack the cabin.)

(AWfCLE MOVEMENT AND MANEUVER
With Paranoia's dramatic tactical ') combat system, the gamemaster improvises 11 the de¬tails of vehicle movement and maneuver. No hexes and movement rates. No opportunity for tactical wargaming and careful rules exploita¬tion. Just dramatic action and roleplaying. Like this:
1.	The driving player describes the maneu¬ver he wants a vehicle to perform.
2.	The gamemaster considers the player's request. Is it plausible? Could the vehicle per¬form such a maneuver? How skilled is the opera¬tor? (The gamemaster can require a skill roll if the maneuver is dangerous or unusual, or ifthe operator is unskilled.) What other factors might affect the intended maneuver? (Is the vehicle under hostile fire? Has it been damaged? How reliable is the design, construction and mainte¬nance of the vehicle?) Does the vehicle's bot brain really want to perform the maneuver?
3.	The gamemaster makes a judgment and describes how successfully the vehicle performs the requested maneuver. Routine maneuvers usually go without a hitch. Difficult or dangerous maneuvers with unskilled operators often turn out very badly. The vehicle may go out of control and crash. The wings may fall off in a high-G combat
maneuver. Instead of skimming over a tree, a flybot may attempt to ram and board it.,

Be dramatic. Be entertaining. Scare them to death. Reward ingenuity and bravery with thrilling success (orironic failure). It'syourmovie. Just make sureyourplayers have asense of some ability to influence events with cleverness and audacity. Make sure the aim is

ATTACKWG l/EWCLES AMD TUE/R SUCKERS (ER,
OCCUPANTS)
When attacking a vehicle and/or its occupants with a weapon, the attackers has two options: he may either shoot at the occupants or the vehicle. (Area attack weapons may only be fired at vehicles, not at the occupants themselves.)
f64 
In either event, first determine whether he hits. Modify his weapon skill number in accordance with circumstances and whim (go ahead; it's easy and fun!)
After modifying the skill number, make a skill roll, just as in regular combat. Ifthe roll is a success, the attacker has hit something.
Vehicles can have armor, just like characters. Whether the attacker is shooting at the vehicle or its occupants, subtract the vehicle's armor rating from the weapon rating (if appropriate).
SHOOTMG AT OCCUPANTS
If the attacker was shooting at an occupant, also subtract the occupant's armor rating from the damage number (if appropriate) — that is, occupants are protected both by the vehicle's armor and their own. Then, roll on the Damage Table to determine what damage the occupant suffers.
SHOOTMG AT Ifwcus
Roll on the Damage Table to determine what damage the vehicle suffers. Damage results translate as follows:
Stun=Insignificant Damage: Bullet-holes, dents, scratches, on the paintj ob. Describe appropriately to the players.
Wound = Minor Damage: Some vehicle systems may be disabled; repair is possible using the vehicle maintenance and operation skill. Occupants not affected unless a crash occurs.
Wounded, Unconscious = Minor Damage, Minor Malfunction: The vehicle takes a wound and lurches one way or the other. The difficulty number of all vehicle operation skills are increased by two for each wound the vehicle has taken so far until it is repaired.
Lots of Wounds = Major Damage: Vehicle systems shot to hell. Repair would be difficult (halve skill number or worse). Occupants not affected unless a crash occurs.
Dead = Destroyed: Vehicle is a total loss. A crash occurs.
If the vehicle crashes as a result of its damage (this automatically occurs on a "destroyed" result), roll on the Vehicular Accidents and Falling from Great Heights Table for each occupant of the vehicle to determine what damage he suffers. Normally, the determining factor is the speed of the crashing vehicle, which must be estimated by the gamemaster. However, the gamemaster may permit a Strength, Agility or Power roll for a character to jump from a crashing vehicle or aircraft.
Note: Normally, melee, primitive melee, and primitive aimed weapons have no effect on vehicles or their occupants. However, if a character attempts such a dramatically correct but absurd attack on a vehicle or its occupants, play it by ear. If a Troubleshooter armed with no more than a hand-made bow is standing up against traitors in a flybot. perhaps that arrow will find its mark in ajet intake or an operator's eye. When in doubt, give them a chance — after all, a skill roll of 1 is always success, right?
№WCU И/eAPOMS AA/O 0£££A/S£ SrST£MS
A whole bunch of different weapons and defense systems are commonly mounted on Alpha Complex vehicles. They can be fired either on manual, or by the controlling bot brain (if there's one installed in the vehicle). Bot brains can fire all devices in a single round; a human operator can only fire one (although different operators could fire different systems). A bot's chance of hitting depends on how good its software is — basically, the bot has a skill number with each of its weapons.
Laser Cannon: These are large field lasers mounted on vehicles. Laser cannon Is are charged from a capacitor. Recharging the weapon after firing takes 10 combat rounds. Laser cannon Us have larger capacitors, and can fire three times before recharging. Recharging takes five combat rounds. Laser cannon Ills have massive power systems that permit an unlimited rate of fire of one shot per combat round, but the power systems are so big that only the largest and most powerful vehicles can carry them. They do "FL" damage, as they blanket targets with massive and intense beams of light.
Sonic Blaster: The sonic blaster delivers a sonic shock wave in a 60 degree arc to the front ofthe weapon. Any individual within that arc and within range may suffer damage. Their barrage does "FE" damage.

Tube Cannon: Tube cannon are
vehicle-mounted cone rifles which fire shells at the same range and with the same effect as cone rifle shells. Tube cannon Is do not have automatic reloaders, so a person must be avail¬able to reload the cannon after each firing. The rate of fire is one shell per round. Tube cannon Us are equipped with very fast automatic reloaders and can fire two shells per round. They do damage according to the cone rifle rounds they fire.
Firethrower: This is a very large, vehicle-mounted flamethrower. It fires ten times before it needs reloading. It does "FE" damage.
Missile Rack: This is a mount for a missile. Each rack may hold one missile. When
the missile is fired, the rack must be reloaded before it can be fired again. Missile racks can only be reloaded from the outside of the vehicle as it is resting stationary, so they cannot normally be reloaded during combat. Each missile moves at 300 m/sec, and remains live for 10 combat rounds (unless it is triggered before then). A missile consists of four parts: the warhead (identical in effect and variety to cone rifle shells); the propellant (which moves the missile); a fuse (identical to the varieties available for cone rifles), and a homing device. Below are the available types of homing devices:
None: The missile continues in the direction it was fired until the fuse is triggered or the propellant is exhausted.
Heat-Seeking: The missile heads toward the hottest object in front of it. This is usually
an enemy vehicle's exhaust, but can sometimes be the sun, a camp fire, or even a Troubleshooter's body heat.
HARM: The missile heads toward the strongest radio signal in front of it. This is usually an enemy radar, but may sometimes be a com unit, a commercial radio station, or a Walkman. The enemy can kill the missile by turning their radar/radio off.
Radar Homing: The missile is equipped with radar, and heads toward the "brightest" object its radar detects. This is usually the biggest, most metallic object in the sky, though, for example, chaff or a large metallic object on the ground could divert it.
Painted Radar-Homing: The vehicle which fires the missile must follow its target, "painting" the target with a radar signal. The missile heads for the "painted" target. Ifthe painting vehicle changes course and stops painting the target, the missile loses the target and just keeps on going.
Painted Laser Homing: Like above, only the target is painted with a laser instead of a radar.
Missile racks fire cone rile shells.
Gas Thrower: This fills the area around the vehicle with gas of any of the types available for cone rifles. Essentially, everything within 20 m of the vehicle is affected by the gas. It is usually used by stationary vehicles to discourage curious natives or hoodlums who want the hubcaps. The gas reservoir allows the weapon to continue operation for 10 combat rounds.
Anti-Missile Lasers: This is a battery of several dozen low-power lasers which fire all in the some general direction at once. The idea is to destroy an incoming missile before it strikes the vehicle. Anti-missile lasers can also be used against individual targets, such as human beings,-but they do not do much damage because of their low power. (If used against humans, the damage number is L8.) Anti-missile lasers are usually mounted at the rear of the vehicle, since missiles often pursue a fleeing vehicle.
Smoke Grenades: When a smoke generator is operated by a stationary vehicle, it increases the "L" (anti-laser) armor protective rating of the vehicle by 5. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
Chaff Casters: These devices may divert a radar-homing or painted radar-homing missile from its target. If the operator makes a successful weapons skill roll, the missile is diverted. After ten uses, the chaff-caster must be reloaded.
Radar Jammers: They work in the same way as chaff casters. Radar jammers also prevent any radio communication within 10 km of the jamming device.
Gaussers: Gaussers work in essentially the same way, but also affect HARM missiles.
Heat-Maskers: These work in the same way as chaff casters, but affect heat-seeking missiles only.
Armor: Vehicles can be mounted with armor of any armor type and rating.

Here are two sample vehicles:
VULTURC И/ARR/OR 920
Clearance: Violet
Appearance: Sleek, carefully machined, incredibly fast and deadly, the Vulture Warrior 920 is a VTOL (vertical take-off-and-landing) twin-engine fixed-wing vehicle.
Engine intakes are mounted on the wings and central exhaust at the rear ofthe craft. The tail fin is as large as the wings, permitting the craft to "fly" while rolled 120 degrees right or left for considerable periods of time. Cockpit is forward; four mounts under the wings can be used for missiles or rocket pods.
Function: The Vulture Warrior 920 is a fighter-bomber, used primarily on strike or infantry-support missions, but usable also in air-to-air combat. It is one of the fastest aircraft available to Alpha Complex, and, because it is capable of VTOL, is sometimes used to deliver Troubleshooter mission groups to remote areas when quick delivery is required.
Vulture Warrior 920: I am the Vulture Warrior 920, the most sophisticated aerial combat vehicle in the world. I can defeat dozens of lesser aircraft in air-to-air combat. I can take off and land on airstrips less than ten meters in length. My fusion generators permit me to fly for decades without refueling. I have destroyed twenty-three tankbots and assisted in the destruc¬tion of a Mark IV Continental Siege Machine. I can destroy cities at a single blow. I am to act as your transport on Mission X76V. I, the Vulture Warrior 920, am to act as a glorified translator.
Weapons: The Vulture Warrior 920 is equipped with two laser cannon Us; four missile racks; anti-missile lasers; a smoke-generator; heat-maskers; radar-jammers; a chaff- caster; and electronic counter-measures. The Vulture Warrior 920 has been used from time to time to deliver small nuclear warheads on suspected Commie concentrations.
Armor is FAII8.
Bot Brain: The Vulture Warrior 920 is incredibly arrogant. It knows it is the pinnacle of Alpha Complex technology and one of the Computer's most deadly war machines. It TkC Ifl/17VR£ 920 PIY80T thinks Vulture troopers are the finest of clonekind, the cream offighting men. It thinks Troubleshooters are scum, and it is greatly galled that it is called upon to carry them.
Troubleshooter: Vulture Warrior 920! Where are we going?
Vulture Warrior 920: Quiet, maggot.
Use in Troubleshooter Missions: The
Vulture Warrior920 usually seats two—a pilot and weapons officer. In fact, it needs neither, as the bot brain itselfis quite capable offying and operating the craft singlehandedly. The Com¬puter sends a pilot mainly because the Com¬puter always sends at least two beings along on any mission, to keep an eye on each other. For Troubleshooter delivery missions, the bomb bay ofthe Vulture Warrior 920 is converted to seat¬ing. Crude chairs are installed, and the Trouble¬shooters are strapped in.

Before the mission begins, a grizzled Violet-clearance Vulture captain gives orders to the Vulture Warrior 920. The Vulture Warrior 920 will follow these orders enthusiasti¬cally and to the letter. It will interpret them in the way least convenient to the Troubleshooters, whom it despises. It will not respond to any order or suggestions from Troubleshooters once in the air. Ifthe Troubleshooters want to issue the Vulture Warrior 920 any orders or instructions, they had best ask the captain nicely.
The Vulture Warrior 920 responds in the best English sergeant-major tradition to its orders:
Captain: Vulture Warrior 920!
Vulture Warrior920: Sah !
Captain: You are to deliver these Troubleshooters to coordinates X7Y9Z17.
Vulture Warrior 920: Yes, sah!
Captain: You are to fly directly to those coordinates, evading enemy fire as necessary.
Vulture Warrior 920: At once, sah!
Captain: You are to deliver them safely and in good condition.
Vulture Warrior920: Y es, sah !
Captain: Any questions?
Vulture Warrior 920: No, sah! 1 understand, sah!
Captain: Very good. Dismissed!
Vulture Warrior 920: Sah! All right, maggots; embark!
Once airborne, the Vulture Warrior 920 pays no attention to the fact that its passengers are human. It accelerates at several Gs, turns sharply, climbs and dives, etc. Any citizen not strapped in will tumble about the cabin dangerously. Anyone strapped in must make Endurance rolls to avoid vomiting.
Ifthe Vulture Warrior 920 runs into opposition, it sees no need to inform its passengers of that fact.
Vulture Warrior 920: (Turns sharply and goes into a steep dive.)
Troubleshooter: Hey, what's going on?
Vulture Warrior 920: (No response. Goes into continuous barrel roll.)
Troubleshooter: (Gagging.) Hey, what are those explosions outside?
Vulture Warrior 920: Flak.
Troubleshooter: Uh, oh. Evade!
Vulture Warrior 920: Morons. I'm carrying morons. What do you think I'm doing?
The Troubleshooters may assume that the Vulture Warrior 920 will use its VTOL capabilities to land at its destination and let them off. That, in fact, was what the Computer assumed it would do. However, the Vulture Warrior 920 sees no reason to waste time and energy making things comfy for a bunch of maggots. It will fly over its destination, open the bomb bay doors, and expect the Troubleshooters to jump. Yes, parachutes are available. No, none ofthe Troubleshooters has any training in their use.
FLVBOT f?fA7V)
Clearance: Indigo
Appearance: At first glance, Flybot 17 appears to be a bulbous, ant-like subcompact car — a little like a VW Bug. A mud-spattered exterior and rusted dents do nothing to improve its looks. Normally, Flybot 17 is driven along the ground. However, in the trunk,
four folded rotors are stored. These can be removed, unfolded, and bolted to a shaft which protrudes from the roof.
Function: "ATV stands for "all-terrain vehicle," and that's what Flybot 17 is. It was designed during a period of budgetary stringency in Alpha Complex, and hence is constructed with the cheapest materials and in the simplest way. It is, mirabile dictu, remarkably sturdy and reliable. It is also — so what else is new? — remarkably limited.
Flybot 17 can travel on land, using its dinky subcompact wheels. However, any terrain rougher than a superhighway is tough going. The shock absorbers are practically useless, any slope over 15 degrees is impossible.
It can travel on water—like a VW Bug, it can float, and by spinning its wheels rapidly, make some slight headway. However, it can't really steer on water, any surf is likely to swamp it, and in a river it can do little more than drift.
And it can travel in the air. With its rotors attached, Flybot 17 becomes a helicopter, of sorts. Its little micropile engine can turn the rotors just fast enough to lift off— ifthe vehicle is not too heavily loaded. It can carry six passengers — ifthey 're not bringing much of anything with them. 
				Vi:iiili|Hii:iiVi«,|l*«i:i:i'lua Paranoia Л The Fifth Edition
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
The shaft which turns the rotors passes directly through the passenger compart¬ment, linking up with the drive shaft un¬der the passengers' feet. It is unshielded.
Consequently, when the Flybot 17 flies, the passengers will be sitting right next to a drive-shaft spinning at several hundred revolutions per minute. If the Flybot 17 is fully loaded — with six passengers — the middle passenger in the back seat will be sitting with one leg on either side of the shaft. This ought to make him nervous.
When flying, Flybot 17 can move at a little more than 50 kilometers per hour. It has difficulty climbing, especially with six passengers, so there may be some scary moments clearing treetops. Flying over mountains means circling and circling and circling for hours, trying to get enough altitude.
Because ofthe flybot's slow speed, when flying in a brisk wind the passengers may find themselves moving very slowly indeed — or even backwards.
Weapons: The Flybot 17 is completely unarmed and unarmored. If fired upon while flying, a "minor damage" result means one ofthe rotors has been shot out. As a result, the flybot crashes. Luckily, it's unlikely to be flying at high altitude. Unluckily, this means that passengers are tossed about the passenger compartment, possibly into the speeding drive shaft.
Bot Brain: The Flybot 17 is not equipped with a bot brain or any other autopilot device . This means the gamemaster should call for frequent flybot operation and maintenance skill rolls. "Failed your roll, eh? I guess that means you fly into the tree. Yup. Y our engine cuts out and everyone is safe and sound — but Flybot 17(ATV) is now ten meters up in a healthy-looking maple." It also means that the Troubleshooters must find their own destination—which Complex-raised citizens with no experience ofthe Outdoors may find difficult.
Use in Troubleshooter Missions: Because ofits reliability, sturdiness, and expend- ability, the Flybot 17(ATV) is frequently used on Troubleshooter missions in the Outdoors.

These two vehicles are good examples to study when constructing your own Paranoia deathtraps (um, vehicles). Here's how to design your own:
1.	Choose a Form ofMovement: Wheels, walkers, treads, hovercrafts, propellers (in the water or in the air), jets, fixed wing aircraft, helicopters, submarines, tunnelers. Maybe it runs on tracks, or in tubes, or is launched from a catapult.
2.	Choose a Shape: It can look sleek and deadly or battered and used. It can be huge, tiny, or in between. It can look like anything, as long as the way it looks and what it's supposed to do make some sense together. For instance, we wouldn't build a spherical j et fighter. Generally, extremes are more funny than the middle ground; huge or tiny are both better than middling. A flying wing or a jet pack are both better than a DC-10.
3.	Decide What It'll Fit: How many people will it carry?
4.	Decide What It's Supposed to Do: Is it a transport? Or a war machine?
5.	Decide on Its Personality: Does it have a hot brain? Ifso, what's the bot like? Every bot has its own personality, and, this being Paranoia, any bot the players are forced to deal with should be difficult. Ifyou give the players a vehicle controlled by a bot brain, you're creating an opportunity for some inspired roleplaying on your part.
6.	Decide on Its Weapons and Capabilities: Look over the list ofvehicle weapons above, and decide ifyour vehicle carries any ofthem. Decide what its armor is, and what the weapons skills ofits bot brain (if any) are. Decide on any other capabilities you want to build in.
/69 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
7.	Build in Obvious Fatal Flaws: Every Paranoia vehicle should have some obvious fatal flaw to trip up its users. Flybot 17 has a bunch ofthem — the spinning rotor shaft, its inability to climb quickly, its limited carrying capacity, and so on. Here are some other possibilities to consider: limited fuel supply; autopilot with a tendency to travel in circles; collapsing landing gear; "walking" vehicle with a tendency to trip, etc. A moment's thought should give you half a dozen awkward, inconvenient or dangerous ways to build a vehicle — inflict them on your players.
8.	Throw in a Surprise or Two: Some flaws shouldn't be so obvious. It's always fun to spring a nasty surprise on your players when they're well into the wilderness and can't do anything about it. Much of Paranoia's humor comes from placing Troubleshooters in horribly dangerous circumstances and forcing them to act; dangerous and inconvenient vehicles are an obvious gimmick.
9.	Make ’Em Do It To Themselves: When you put in lots of buttons and different controls, take the time to write down what each button or control does . . . and hide it from the players.
Gamemaster: Okay, you're in the open-canopied, wheeled autobot. The Ooga-Booga Outdoors natives are attacking. What do you do?
Player: Close the roof!
Gamemaster: I see. And how do you do this?
Player: Um . . . hit the "close canopy" button?
Gamemaster: You look down at the hundreds of buttons, toggles, switches, dials, wheels, zippers, velcro attachments and — (Rolls dice) — oh! A spear sprouts from your chest! You die. Anyone else want to give it a try?
Player Two: I start hitting red buttons!
Gamemaster: Very good. (Checks his notes.) The vehicle lurches forward as you hit the first button, throwing the Ooga-Booga offyour hood. Then the canopy starts to go up. Then it goes down. Then you discover the autocar has an optional VTOL device. You, the autocar, and several Ooga-Boogas are thrown a hundred meters into the air in an uncontrollable ascent.
Player Two: I hit green buttons!
Gamemaster: Y ou hear a hum and a whirring sound. Hey! Y ou started the engine! The wheels are turning! You hit the ground running . . . (Rolls some dice.) Ouch. You're gonna need a mechanic to fix that.
So go on. Invent your own vehicles. There are dozens ofpossibilities. Walkers. Rolling vehicles. Hovercraft. Jet-propelled autocars. Tunneling vehicles. Subways. Interconti¬nental rockets.
A vehicle is mostly a way to get player characters from point A to point B; all you really want it to do is provide some comic relief in between. Comic relief in Paranoia usually means horrible danger. As a result, Troubleshooters frequently don't get to point B. That's no problem; activate the next set of clones and start them over. They won't make the same mistake twice, and eventually someone will get to B.
Don't worry about making your vehicles "too powerful," that is, giving them too much in the way of armor or weapons. You can give the vehicle as much power as you want — just don't let the Troubleshooters use it. Vulture Warrior 920 is an example; its controlling hot brain has definite ideas ofits own and is not about to let a bunch ofmaggots tell it what to do. You can get the same effect in a number of other ways. For example, since a vehicle's capabilities are classified higher than the Troubleshooters, they may not know how powerful it is, and could not order it to use, e.g., its laser cannon. If they did, they would be displaying treasonous knowledge.
Don't worry about plausibility; R&D is always coming up with cockeyed gadgets. You can always claim a vehicle was experimental ifit proves too silly. Don't worry about "game balance;" there's always a way to crock a device so the players don't get much use out of it (and the Computer is always around if things start to get out of hand).

When you're done exploiting all the nasty little facets of the equipment we've listed above, hustle the Troubleshooters offto Research and Design for a little more fun with technology.
As discussed previously in this book, R&D is where the Computer has new, experimen¬tal equipment designed and allocated for testing. Who does the testing? Why, Trouble¬shooters, of course!
Oh, the R&D techs do a little testing on their own—but that's laboratory testing. They need fresh meat . . . err, subjects to test their devices in the field. The Troubleshooters are 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
the perfect Service Group for this mission. The Computer has assigned a wide variety of clones from different backgrounds to the Troubleshooters, so if anyone can adequately test the devices R&D comes up with, they can.
Besides, it gets the lethal little mechanisms out of R&D's hands.
И/ндт Do Tkose Ttcwes DRBAM UP, AWWAV?
Anything you can dream up.
Think about what I said earlier about Alpha Complex technology. No clone really knows how to do anything really useful with it. The R&D techs are assisted by bots and by the R&D Computer nodes and they are using old, probably better technology, to base their new adventures on.
This isn't to say what they are creating doesn't work — oh, it works all right, but it seldom works as planned.
Research and Design is part technological advancement, part bureaucracy. The Computer likes new and wiftier toys for Its clones to play with — the more complex the better — but It isn't going to throw resources down a traitor hole without some results.
So R&D gives the Computer results. The motto of R&D should be "If it does anything, it's a success!"

Try to think like a committee. A blind committee with as little touch with reality as possible. You and your technology-oriented friends are being given a huge budget, but only as long as you keep coming out with "advancements" that Troubleshooters can test. These advancements have to be convoluted enough that you can blame the testers for any malfunction, and spiffy enough in looks or description to justify the resources you're spending on them. And each one needs to out-do the last. 

 
The following are some examples you can use to invent your own R&D devices to torment your players with.

A laser rifle works, right? Okay, sure, it'll malfunction once in a while, but it's pretty reliable, right? Well, as an R&D tech, you can't "settle" for reliable — you have to go for exciting, bold, and innovative.
So, you form a committee (gamemasters, you do this in a fictional sense) to explore possible improvements to the laser rifle:
R&D Tech #1: "Invariably, clones using laser rifles miss their targets more than half the time. This leads to unnecessary damage of Computer equipment, property, and other clones, as well as a waste of ammo."
R&D Tech #2: "Right! And as for that ammo thing—Troubleshooters get blown away by Commie mutant traitors everydaycle, just because they run out of ammo! We have to do something about that."
R&D Tech #3: "And what about theft? The Computer and PLC do their best to make sure that only the right clone has a laser rifle, but they can only do so much. Too many traitors are found with laser rifles — and who knows how much damage they can reek upon loyal citizens ofAlpha Complex."
f?t 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
R&D Tech #4: "So what you're saying, is, laser rifles in improper, untrained hands cause lots of damage to the Computer and loyal citi¬zens. Maybe we should introduce some sort of feature that keeps this from happening as well."
And so ...
The LaserMatic SmartGun 20-20! Anew innovation from your friends at R&D!
The LMSG 20-20 is a wonder oftechnological innovation, and the ideal weapon for the loyal Troubleshooter. Research and Design has la¬bored long nightcycles, burning the midnightcycle fusion core to come up with this beauty—take it out and try it today! It's notjust an advertising thing — it's the Mandatory Thing!™
The Real Skinny on the LMSG 20-20: The
first innovation to the laser rifle was to address the problem Troubleshooters seem to have with accuracy — theyjust aren't real good shots. At first, laser sights and electronic balancing sights were introduced, but accuracy only went up about 15% ... too low a percentage for a real innovation. So those ideas were shelved.
Instead, the R&D techs went after the extra¬neous damage problem. Obviously, you don't want to reduce the amount of damage the weapon does — it would be useless in a fight — so they decided to reduce how much damage the weapon does to non-targets.
After conducting extensive tests, the R&D techs determined that, of all shots fired by Troubleshooters in the field using laser rifles, only 30% were hits. Of the 70% that were misses, 50% caused collateral damage to mis¬cellaneous clones, Computer property, and inci¬dentals.
Of those three articles, only Computer prop¬erty was deemed really important. Clones are supposed to get out of the way of laser shots (unless they are traitors), so it was their own fault if they got hit. Nobody knew what "inci¬dentals" were, so they were deemed unimpor¬tant as well. So, of all laser rifle shots, a full 25% damaged Computer property in the field.
So, the R&D techs introduced their "SmartDamage" system. It is based on the same principles that keep transtube lines open and flybots avoiding crashes — too technical to go into here. When the SmartDamage system senses the laser rifle is going to miss, it substitutes a beam oflight for the laser burst, simulating the shot (so the Troubleshooter will see how to readjust his aim) but not wasting the ammunition.
Unfortunately, the SmartDamage hot brain has no way of knowing whether the Troubleshooter is firing at an approved target or not — it is supposed to make that decision itself. So, it has randomized the problem. Thirty-five percent of shots fired from the LMSG are harmless beams oflight. The other 65% are laser beams of normal power. (Gamemaster: Roll Id20 after each shot. On a 1 through 7, the rifle fires a beam oflight. On anything else, it fires a normal laser beam).
This helps to solve the ammo problem, but doesn't do it adequately. So, R&D introduced the revolving cylinder ammo changer. Instead of only holding one laser barrel,

f?2 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY ...
the rifle holds five. When it runs out of ammo on the first barrel, it automatically revolves around to the second, and so on.
Unfortunately, the SmartDamage system has interfered with this. It has to tell the mechanism when to revolve and when not to based on how many "real" shots Were fired and how many light beams. Itjust isn't a big enough bot to handle both things at once so, sometimes, it will cause a magazine to revolve when there are still shots remaining and, sometimes, it will just fire beams ofharmless light continuously, thinking it is still loaded.
As far as the theft problem goes, the SmartDamage bot brain was equipped with an ID system based on the Computer's own. Periodically, it will ask the Trouble¬shooter, "Please place tongueprint on stock ID board for possession and fire authorization." If the Troubleshooter does not take a round to do this (during which he can perform no other actions), the bot brain will inform him,
"ID user not responding; commencing shutdown now."
Then, in order to keep the LMSG from falling into a
traitor's hands it will cause a malfunction in one ofthe laser barrels. The only remedy is to either eject the malfunctioning barrel (a tough laser rifles roll) within one round and put your tongue on the stock ID. If one barrel explodes, they all do, causing P15 damage to anyone in a three meter radius, and destroying the gun.
Finally, R&D Tech #4's comments were pretty much redundant — they covered everything the other techs were saying. But, just so he wouldn't be cut out ofthe project and possibly reassigned, he contributed a really mean lookingbarrel design and shoulder- strap. There are no game effects for these, but they keep him in ajob.
As you can see, creating an R&D device can be a long process — from the R&D tech's point ofview. In reality, since you need to share only as much ofthe above information with your players as you choose, you can work backwards. It'sjust a matter of getting in the right mindset.
PAROOV rs A GOOD OfffA/se
If you don't feel like modifying an existing device, take something from the Old Reckoning—preferably something your players will recognize—and make fun ofit. R&D is riddled with Romantics (they're funny that way) who want to develop "new" devices based on Old Reckoning technology.
But they never seem to get it quite right...
Pent-I-UMM’s Processor: Based on literature found in an Old Reckoning ware¬house, the Pent-I-UMM Processor is a new bot brain developed by R&D Tech Pent-I-UMM for use by Troubleshooters in the field. Its function: to improve morale by providing fresh, hot meals every day- and nightcycle for the loyal team.
The bot brain can be plugged into any jackobot, scrubot, docbot, or warbot currently assigned to the team (in addition to the other bot's brain) and it will share that bot's peripherals and come packaged with some of its own:
•	The WonderWhip: Usually replacing a weapon mount, scrub-brush, arm or surgical chainsaw, the WonderWhip can be installed easily by any clone with robot ops & maintenance. It is a combination whisk and blender, and can stir, blend, or liquefy any substance the Trouble-shooters might desire to eat.
•	NutriFind Processor: When Troubleshooters are in enemy simplexes or Outdoors, they can't always find food they are sure they can eat. The NutriFind Processor is a combination sensor apparatus and food processor attached to any other bot in exchange, usually, for a external peripheral. Just put any questionable nutrient in the processor, and the bot brain will identify and separate nutrients from harmful substances.
•	SupraCarbonator: An internal device used to make scavenged beverages more palatable to to the discriminating Troubleshooter, the SC is equipped with a carbonation device and FlavorFill Supplement Injector. It will make yummy-tasting soft drinks out of any liquid.
•	And So On ...
Unfortunately, by equipping the Pent-I-UMM Processor with all these neat little features, the R&D techs overloaded its poor bot brain. Now, instead of doing everything itself, it "recruits" assistance from the bot brain it is paired with. This leads to some interesting problems:
fP3 
Troubleshooter: Ah! A long day of shooting traitors. I think I'd like a nice meal and soft drink, friend PenBot.
Pent-I-UMM BotBrain: Please remove laser weapon peripheral from warbot and install Processor peripherals.
Troubleshooter: Oh, of course ... (a few minutecycles later) ... There! Now make me a meal fit for a clone!
Pent-I-UMM: Of course ... Whiirrr, spin, KAT-chimg! Here you are, sir.
Troubleshooter: Ah ... smells good. Slurp ... SPIT! Gah! What is this?! It tastes horrible! Pent-I-UMM: Um ... I didn't have any gravy, sir, so the warbot brain suggested ... Troubleshooter: (Wretching uncontrollably) Yugh! What?
Penti-I-UMM: ... Napalm. Would you care for a light?
LOTS AMO LOTS Of BOTTOMS
As mentioned in the section on Vehicle Design (above), making the Troubleshooters "do it to themselves" is always fun. Well, with R&D, you should go all out. Put in buttons, dials, and switches, then cheerfully tell the Troubleshooters they are assigned to determine what combinations do what with a device.
This can work with wholly strange devices, but it works even better with gadgets the Troubleshooters think they know what they are supposed to do. For example, ifyou gave the Troubleshooters the LMSG 20-20 above, they would know it's a laser weapon from its name and its appearance. That's fine. But then throw in a few extra buttons and don't tell them what they do. They can find out in several different ways ...
Troubleshooter: Hey! Why have you stopped firing! Ijust keyed in my tongueprint! LMSG: Yes, sir, and we have established your right to wield me. Now, however, you must type in the firing code for the laser setting.
Troubleshooter: What firing code?! I wasn't told of any firing code!
LMSG: That's because you'll be programming it, sir. Just push a few ofthose buttons near my barrel... that's it. Remember the ones you pushed.
Troubleshooter: Oh, very well... (Pushes a few buttons)
LMSG: No! Not those buttons — the ones on the other ... WARNING! WARNING!
REMOTE MISSILE LAUNCH TRIGGERED! PRESS "CANCEL FIRE" SEQUENCE TO ABORT!
Troubleshooter: Remote missile?! What remote missile?! (Pushing buttons madly, to
 
Troubleshooter: WHAT targeting zone?! WHERE are the missiles going?! LMSG: Hmmn? What? What are you talking about? What's that whistling sound?

PROS AMO COA/S
One final word on R&D and we'll let you go on to the next chapter (yes, you're welcome). Even though R&D is supposed to be yet another way to screw your players, you'll probably want to throw a few working items, or at least non-lethal to the Troubleshooters devices, into the mix. Making them cringe and flee from R&D devices is good — but if they know everything is going to kill them immediately, they'll become jaded.
Troubleshooter: Another R&D device to test? Very well. I'lljust go nip off and shoot myself now, all right?
Put in enough of a mix that Troubleshooters will hope they can get away with testing equipment and surviving ... and maybe even get something good in the process. 
Congratulations, Citizen, you have now learned enough Ultraviolet clearance infor¬mation to be executed many times over — in other words, you are now only fit to serve the Computer as a Paranoia gamemaster.
Well, I suppose you can go back and be a Paranoia player ifyou want — but you'll have to feign extreme ignorance of everything you've read so far ifyou don't want to be executed for treasonous knowledge. Of course, maybe you want to be executed. Maybe you get off on that sort ofthing. Hey, it takes all kinds.
DON'T Rew ms СнАРтек!!!
Ifyou aren't a Paranoia gamemaster, or ifyou aren't planning on running Paranoia right away (that is, before somebody else does), don't read this chapter. While you can feign ignorance of the Paranoia rules and deny knowledge of secret societies, mutant powers, high clearance equipment, and all that other neat gamemaster-only stuff and still have a ball playing the game, you'll actually be spoiling the fun for yourself and for everyone else ifyou read this chapter and don't run it.
See, this chapter is a pregenerated Paranoia adventure. It is supposed to introduce the world ofParanoia to new players and gamemasters by providing a fun, easy-to-run, at- no-extra-cost adventure. Ifyou read it and then run it for your players, then you should have a good start on your Paranoia campaign. However, ifyou read it and then somebody else runs it, you'll know all the secrets and obstacles in the adventure ahead oftime, and you'll ruin everyone's fun — starting with your own.
веттше Smureo
So, you've decided to run this adventure for your friends. Terrific. I'm happy for you. I pity them, though, because this is a nasty adventure designed to really mess with new Paranoia players' minds. Other games put out easy introductory adventures, designed to allow new players to make mistakes and learn from them without getting their first characters killed too quickly.
In Paranoia, that's how they learn.
WHAT YOU A/TTD
First of all, you need a working knowledge of the game and Alpha Complex. I'm going to presume you have that — ifyou've read this book through (which I hope you have ... I hate it when people start at the end), you know pretty much what Paranoia is about and you know enough to use the rules to your advantage. Don't worry if you don't have everything down pat. In Paranoia, when the gamemaster makes a mistake, nobody dares point it out — unless they really want their characters chewing on an HE cone rifle round.
Second, you need to help your players create characters. Alternatively, you can use 
pregenerated Troubleshooters we created and printed later on in this book. Either way works out fine — the latter method is quicker and easier for you, but the former is generally more fun.
Photocopy either the blank Paranoia Character Sheet (front and back) or each ofthe pregenerated characters as many times as you need for your own personal use. We give you permission. Yes, I know, it would be more patriotic ifyou cut out the characters and the blank sheet and went out and bought another copy ofthis book for your own use every time you did this, but the Computer understands.
Third, read the adventure. Read it at least once, maybe twice, and reference any parts ofthe book you need to understand it fully. Y ou can make any changes you want—include more gags, cut out episodes, or whatever—but you need to be familiar with the adventure to do it. A good gamemaster needs to spend as little time flipping through the book as he can—the more delays you cause, the more time the players have to think about what they are supposed to be doing, and we don't want that. Keep 'em offbalance.
ADMMTutte BACKGROUND
In keeping with traditional Paranoia, this adventure is actually a semi-sequel to the original Paranoia, Second Edition introductory adventure "Into the Outdoors with Gun and Camera." Wait! Stop! You don't have to go out and search through bookstores and game racks for Paranoia, SecondEdition — you don't need anything but this book to play. I'm just setting the stage, here.
You see, in the original adventure, the Troubleshooters were assigned to leave Alpha Complex and venture into the Outdoors — exploring the wild, untamed, partly-irradiated and definitely Not Safe world of the future. Having grown up in Alpha Complex's domes, however, they first had to cope with the idea that there were no ceilings and few walls Outdoors, and the Computer wasn’t everywhere.
A sobering experience.
It was also a good way to get new Paranoia players involved in the world. See, the Troubleshooters started out in Alpha Complex, but then had to venture Outdoors. For the players, this meant they started out by getting partially used to the unfamiliar "indoors" world of Alpha Complex, and then they were thrust into what was, for them, a fairly familiar world — but they had to pretend it wasn't. Trees became "brown poles," ground became "green-covered, soft-textured floor" and the sky became "AAAAAH!!!! THERE'S NO CEILING!! AAAAAHHH!!"
Ahem.
Well, in this adventure, the Troubleshooters are assigned as a back-up team to the first one. They have to be briefed by the Computer's briefing officers, get their equipment from PLC, obtain experimental stuff from R&D, and then embark on a dangerous mission. Pretty much the same sort of thing the first team did.
But...
In this adventure, the goal is not to go Outdoors and explore — instead, it is to go Outdoors and eliminate a rogue Troubleshooter team assigned many monthcycles ago to venture into the Outdoors and bring back important information, samples, and prisoners to the Computer.
But they betrayed the Computer and all the loyal clones of Alpha Complex.
Oh, not right away. They were devious traitors. See, they went through all the normal mission procedures normally — they collected their equipment and went through their briefings like any other Troubleshooter team (hardly ever shooting each other in the back)
—	but when they went Outdoors, things got strange. After the first few mission reports and requests for replacement clones, their radio went dead. Repeated attempts at contact
—	first by radio, then by flybot, and finally by Armed Forces search patrols — failed. The Troubleshooters were lost in the Outdoors. Oh, well. Time to send out another team.
Or so everyone thought.
You see, the Computer is much smarter than any mere Troubleshooter, and It finally figured out what was going on. It knew that each ofthe Troubleshooters in the team had several clones left on their six-pack, so the team was not eliminated. It also knew that It had assigned the Troubleshooters everything they would need to survive in the Outdoors
—	Happiness Pills, Bouncy Bubble Beverage, weapons, ammo, a transbot — so they must be alive. The only conclusion was that they have gone renegade.
And the Computer is annoyed.
The new Troubleshooter team will be assigned thejob oflocating and terminating the old team before it can get back to Alpha Complex and spread treasonous information

about Outdoors among the citizenry. Termination vouchers have been issued for each of the traitorous team members (they will be given to the Team Leader at the start of the mission) and no quarter is expected to be asked or given.
As a secondary mission, the Troubleshooters are supposed to collect information about Outdoors as they go, and take soil, vegetable, and tissue samples from everything they encounter. They are supposed to return within two weekcycles, their mission completed.
Of course, the Troubleshooters will probably not know that all information about the Outdoors — including any maps or tips they get from their briefing officers — are classified as security clearance Ultraviolet. This is to be kept secret from them at all times. You see, the Computer is not going to risk Ultraviolet clones on a mission with this much danger — but It definitely wants the mission accomplished. The Troubleshooters will have to deal with this problem when (or if) they return.
AOY£A/TUR£ SYA/OPS/S
The following plot outline will give you a good idea of how the adventure should go. If the Troubleshooters do lots of silly things and get themselves off the track of the adventure, you can use it as a guideline to boot them back on. Or you can change the whole sequence if you want ... but make sure to read over both the outline and the entire adventure before you go changing too much, you hear?
iPtsooe 0H£: WARTY, WARTY
The Troubleshooters are all in their individual creches or dormitories, snoring away the effects of their SleepyTyme capsules. They've gotten a rich, dream-filled two or three hourcycles of slumber before a claxon by each Troubleshooter's head starts ringing. This air raid/nuclear alert siren is the Troubleshooter's alarm clock — it tells the Trouble¬shooter in the most subtle of ways, "Hey, get up, get dressed, and get going — the Computer wants you!" Since the claxon also startles everyone else in the area awake, getting you up and out the door will probably be their mission as well—so it's a quick scene punctuated by blows and curses.
£P/SODT Two; вМ££Шв, BR/TF/HG, WHO'S GOT TH£ BR/TFWG?
When the Troubleshooters get pushed, thrown, or otherwise propelled out of their doors, they meet in a small corridor. The Computer tells them to get to the PSU briefing center ASAP and PDQ, unless they want to turn up DOA down in the food VAT (sorry, I was on a roll). Of course, information on where to find the PSU briefing center is classified, so they'll have to find it on their own.
£P/SOOT THRTT; YOUR Joe, SHOULD YOU CHOOS£ А/or To в£ £RTCUT£D
Having arrived at the briefing center, the Troubleshooters are finally admitted to the briefing room and briefed, in brief, by their briefing officers (sorry; I'm doing it again). They get some sketchy information about their mission, as well as a few maps and other useless gamemaster aids. Then they get shunted offto PLC for equipment.
£P/SOO£ fOUK fs nr M£, OR PLC?
Production, Logistics, and Commissary has been told to outfit the Troubleshooters for a trip Outdoors. Unfortunately, they don't really know what a team going Outdoors needs — the last clones who asked the Computer were demoted, assigned treason points, and then executed for requesting Ultraviolet clearance information — so the equipment assigned will be pretty sketchy. But everything must be signed for. And that includes anything PLC has lost in the last decade or so and is looking for a scapegoat to blame it on, so be careful.
£P/SODT £/YT; A/o GOOD £QU/PMTHT GO£S UHPUH/SHTO
Research and Design has a few ideas what the Troubleshooters might need in the Outdoors, but they're not telling why. Instead, they want you to try out some nifty new gizmos. Go ahead. Try it on. The Computer won't mind. In fact, It insists. Now, when you want to activate it, just push this little — NO! FOR THE COMPUTER’S SAKE, DON'T PUSH IT IN HERE!! 
EP/SODE S/x: ON THE TRMSTUBE MO OUT THE DOOR
The Troubleshooters are then hustled into a transbot and ferried to an outer sector of Alpha Complex—OUT sector, of course. Naturally, the transtube breaks down and they have to walk most ofthe way, but this allows them to make contact with secret society members, pals, and other personages of Alpha Complex. It also gives them a chance to blast each other while nobody much is looking.
Eprsooe SEVEN; Qurr STALUNG MO LEAVE ALREAOV
At long last, the Troubleshooters arrive at the OUT sector airlock. They are appre¬hended by Vulture Troopers who have been ordered to track them down and escort them Outdoors. They are blamed for not showing up on time, even though the transtube broke down, and they will probably get into a couple of fights or heavy grovelling sessions. Eventually, they'll get booted Outdoors.
EPLSOOE E/GHT: TO Sax OUT, TO EXPLORE „ To POUR E/REPOWER DOWNRMGE _
The Troubleshooters go through all the predictable stages of shock at being Outdoors. The gamemaster will probably have to encourage this. They have a couple of encounters with animals and then mutated animals... and, finally, some nasty natives — excuse me, "Outdoor clones" — who want to have them for dinner. Or brunch. Whatever it is, they're on the menu.
At this point, the Troubleshooters encounter different tribes of Outdoors clones and probably start to figure out a little about what's going on. This is dangerous for them, as they will probably have to display treasonous knowledge to do anything with what they find out. The Outdoor clones are followers ofthe traitors they are seeking out, and appear to be battling each other as well as the newly-arrived Troubleshooters.
EP/SODE NLNE: A W/co A foe
The Troubleshooters use their experimental water transbot to escape from the natives, who are threatening to overwhelm them. They have to contend with mutant creatures from the deeps, radioactive water, and raging rapids. They end up at the bottom of a waterfall, captured by one of the tribes.
EP/SOOE Tex; A New TEAM LEADER?
The original team leader has her own little tribe, away from the rest ofthe treasonous clones. She is genuinely trying to return to Alpha Complex, having completed his mission. She has even organized her tribe into a miniature version of Alpha Complex, and started up her own Troubleshooter organization. She wants the Troubleshooters to help her get her tribe back to Alpha Complex. Too bad the Troubleshooters want to kill her.
iPtsooe ELEVEN; BATTLE OE A LOT OE ARM/ES
The Troubleshooters, with or without their new allies, have to make it back through hostile territory to get to Alpha Complex. They must scale the waterfall cliff-face and then sneak upriver through the other tribes. Unfortunately, the appearance ofthe new team has caused all the other old team members to go berserk and start a final war-to-end-all- wars ... right where the Troubleshooters want to go. They'll have to get through it somehow to make it home.
EPtsooe TWELVE: AU WRAPPED OP MO NOWHERE TO GO
Just when everything looks hopeless, the Troubleshooters are rescued by another Troubleshooter team, flybots, and the Armed Forces. Everyone gets into the act, and body parts go flying everywhere.
But, wait — why are they shooting at us?! We're the good guys!
Eventually, the Troubleshooters get obliterated. Those with clone replacements wake up in the same briefing room they started this all in, others are out of the game.
AETERMATH: DeeRtee OR OLE, CmzENf
The debriefing exposes all treason and allows everyone to lie about everyone else. When it's over, any clone still standing might actually get a leg up. Some might get a boot to the head. Read on and find out. 
Ep/sooe Оме; ИТлмеу, WARCY
This episode should be run for every clone individually. It is a quick one, so you can have everyone else leave the room or you can go into another room and call players in as they "wake up." Each player should be given a character (or should have a character created) and read the following:
CLANG-A-CLANG-A-CLANG-A-CLANG-A!
You are awakened by the deafening sound of a claxon ringing right by your head. You jerk awake in the darkness, smashing your forehead into the bunk above yours. Oh, wait, it’s not all dark ... see those pretty lights. Why, I bet you could grab one if you tried ...
Rough hands grab yours and drag you from your bed. You still see the pretty spots, but now you hear not-so-pretty curses and shouts over the sound of the claxon. What was that claxon for, anyway? Your head hurts so much, it’s time to think. Someone presses something into your right hand, but it is almost ripped from your grasp as you are hurled through the air —SMA CK.'
At this point, roll some dice, pretend to check the damage chart, and click your teeth.
Luckily, you’re only stunned. You waver for a moment and then fall back into the crowd of grasping arms. They pick you up to try again and you feel your body arc out into the darkness. But, this time, a blinding light greets you. You hurtle through the light and smack into another wall—a silver one this time. Y ou moan as you look around. You are outside your quarters, wearing nothing but your jammies, and you see several other clones in apparently the same state.
Ifthe player wants to ask any questions, he can do so now — but not too many. Remind him that he is dazed and confused from the bouncing around, and he really doesn't remember much, except what's on his character sheet.
Ifthe player asks about the thing that was jammed into his hand, tell him it is a piece ofpaper with writing on it. Ifyou want, make up a piece ofpaper and give it to him — this would be a nice prop. It should be torn midway through, meaning the T roubleshooter does not get the whole message.
Sample messages can include:
"Beware of the —"
"I'll meet you at —"
"Whatever you do, don't —"
"Roy-G-BIV is a —"
"— and you might survive."
"— so he'll give you the secret weapon."
"— or they'll come looking for you."
The "—" mark shows where you want the paper torn.
If you are using the pregenerated characters, or you are familiar with all the characters being used in the game before the play session, the notes can have little cryptic messages about them as well. Everyone gets one note, but everyone should think they have something special.
Anyone who doesn't ask about a note at this point probably dropped it when they hit the wall and doesn't get one.
TM №RV fMPORTAVT MTSSAGi
The notes are completely unimportant — unless you want them to be. They are supposed to foster paranoia in the players and get them suspicious right from the start. They could have interesting information about-the rest of the adventure, or the other Troubleshooters, but they are probably Red Clearance FishLyke Treats (or red herringbots).
You can make the notes more mysterious ifyou write out the whole message and give halfto one player and halfto the another, or ifyou ask them to make Strength rolls and then appear to rip the paper at a designated point "depending on what they get." This will make them think the notes are important when they really aren't. 
Gmwe AcQi/AtMTiD
Nobody is armed with anything but his or herjammies (Red clearance, of course) and mutant power (not that anyone has one, of course). If anyone wants to start a fight, they can, but even they are a little more likely to try to get to know each other first.

Sooner or later — sooner is better than later, unless something fun is going on — the Computer's voice comes over a hidden speaker. It addresses everyone by name and calls for attention. Anyone who doesn't give it might find themselves at the end ofa remote laser barrel.
"Attention, Troubleshooters!" the Computer’s voice booms. "Welcome to PSU sector and the Troubleshooters! Thank you for volunteering to be a part of the elite team of Alpha Complex treason fighters! Serve the Computer and all will go well."
That’s right, you remember, you were promoted to Red clearance just yesterdaycycle, and you remember hearing something about j oining the T rouble- shooters! Imagine, being a part of the Computer’s own elite strike force! Aren’t you lucky! When you get through screaming in terror and denying having volunteered, the Computer continues:
Allow anyone who wants to to scream in terror or plead to be reassigned. Many clones in Alpha Complex just don't seem to have what it takes to be a Troubleshooter. The Computer ignores it all anyway.
"You are all to report to PSU Briefing Center immediately to receive orders on your first Troubleshooter mission. It is imperative that you report immedi¬ately, as your mission is of a time-critical nature. Failure to report to PSU Briefing Center will result in your termination. Have a nice daycycle, citizens."
At this point, there is a crackling sound and the speaker goes dead. If anyone thinks to ask the Computer where PSU Briefing Center is, they hear a loud sputtering and buzzing, and a small wall panel starts to smoke. A moment later, and the panel will explode, doing damage value 9 plus IdlO to anyone nearby (i.e., anyone who doesn't say they are getting out of the way).
Ep/sooe 7Wo: вмее/не, But ее we, WHO'S вот we Beteewe?
At this point, everyone is standing around in a smoky hallway in scorched pajamas. Pajamas are not advised Troubleshooter mission-wear and being out ofuniform is a Bad Thing. Getting all covered with smoke and soot is a violation of hygiene rules, and ignoring the Computer's orders to report to PSU Briefing Center is a Really Bad Thing.
Still, your players may not know this, even iftheir Troubleshooters should. They may stand around bickering (and occasionally trading punches or mutant power attacks), they may try to formulate a plan for finding the Briefing Center, or they may even try getting back into their dormitories or creches for their uniforms.
None of this is productive.
The Computer said "go to the PSU Briefing Center," and, by Its digital capacitors, that's what It meant. Go there. Which way? Doesn't matter —just go.
Ifthe Troubleshooters tarry or try to reason out which way they can go (and they should have lots of different choices), then you can tell them they hear a rumbling sound. Then a clanking. Then a "swhooshing." Then some more clanking.
If they aren't running by now, they deserve what happens next.
A GLEAM TUBE ts А МАРРУ TUBE
One of the most importantjobs ofbots in Alpha Complex is to keep the place clean. Clones are such messy beings, dropping things here, breaking things there, and generally leaving trash and body parts all over the place. Well, the Scrubot Brigade of PSU sector is among the best in the business at cleaning things up. 
Paranoiai The Fifth Edition iS|i,iiBinl»,iieiS,*,i*4^и"!
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
Тне PSU SCRUBOT BR/GADT
While most scrubots are stupid washer-drones programmed only to sweep and scrub and clean up the most basic messes, the PSU S.B. is an elite unit among scrubots. They were designed as an experiment by HPD&MC to see if super-motivated powerbots would improve performance and morale among bots and clones alike.
It worked, and it didn't.
The PSU S.B. bots are much more intelligent than your average scrubots. They can speak in coherent sentences, they can reason out problems and seldom (if ever) go screaming off into pits, and they are equipped with the best scrub-brushes, rotary sweepers, and SoapFoam injectors of any scrubots in the business. As a result, PSU sector is one of the cleanest sectors in Alpha Complex.
Unfortunately, while most scrubots are slow-moving and small enough to get around (most are able to work in even the busiest corridors of Alpha Complex), the S.B. bots are, shall we say, less subtle. When HPD&MC's sensor nodes detect a spillage, soilage, or general mess in a corridor area, they immediately dispatch the S.B. to deal with it. The
S.B., being highly motivated and programmed to be enthusiastic, roars offto the corridor or room and begins work immediately. Anyone in the way will be trampled, foamed and scrubbed within an inch of his, her, or its life.
Three ofthe S.B. roar around the corner at breakneck speed. Read the following to any players whose characters did not flee fast enough from the scene:
A loud rushing, whining sound is coming from a nearby corner. You want to turn and run, but you find yourself frozen in horrific anticipation. Something wet and white blasts into a nearby wall and splatters you. Sputtering, you taste the Computer's best SoapFoam formula in your mouth. And then you see the first of the brushes.
The three S.B. bots whip around the corner at this point and start scrubbing everything in the area—especially the Troubleshooters. Each has its own specialty and characteristics:
RotorBrush 1000: The RotorBrush 1000 (or RB1K, as its bot buddies call it) is the leader ofthe pack. It has three giant, rotating brushes strong enough to scrape the enamel offyour teeth — even when your mouth isn't open. Its photoreceptors are equipped with super-sensitive soil scanners, and its only desire is to scrub, scrub, scrub. Its brushes can do damage value 12B (+ldlO) to any three targets it chooses to clean, and it has a scrubbing (okay, melee combat) skill value of 15. It is dura-plated and heavily armored (dirt can be a dangerous business)—A115 — and it can take seven wounds before shutting down.
BlastoJet SprayCycle: The BJSC looks almost like a motorcycle with a sidecar. Its super-tread wheels allow it to corner on a plasticred, and it is by far the fastest ofthe three S.B. bots. The BJSC's "sidecar" is really a dual-turreted hydraulic spray cannon. One barrel shoots SoapFoam in either continuous streams or short puddle bursts, while the other barrel fires the WondaRinse extract. The BSJC has a spraying (or energy weapons) skill value of 12P, and either of its cannons can do damage value 9 (+ldlO) to any single target. The BSJC is not very heavily armored (A113), but it can take six wounds before being destroyed.
Mark III Scrubot Deluxe: This slow-moving, efficient S.B. bot looks more like a tank than a scrubot... at first glance. Anyone who has time to look it over notices that it really does look like a scrubot—if scrubots were three meters tall and four meters wide. It moves by using its finishing brushes, which whirl continuously, scrubbing the floor. It has
several smaller arms that it can use to scrub small patches on the walls, missed by its team¬mates. It also has several small water cannons it can use to get at those "hard-to-reach" spots. The-Mark III has general scrubbing and firing skills at skill value 12, has A115 armor, and can take eight wounds before being disabled. It is very slow, but efficient: anything caught under its treads will take damage value 15 (+ldlO) every round. Its lesser "weapons" do more mod¬erate damage (you pick, gamemaster).
Unless the Troubleshooters are complete
morons (?), they will flee the Scrubot Brigade. 

 
Ar all, fighting is useless — the S.B.'s are not Commies or traitors, and they are liable Computer property. Besides, they aren't actually attacking the Troubleshooters iheirjob is to clean up after them. Is it their fault the stupid fleshbags refuse to get out
Hhe way?
IThe Troubleshooters should be running all-out to escape the Scrubot Brigade. Have ki make Agility and dodge rolls occasionally, and herd them down endless corridors. anyone ducks away from the party, they find themselves either reuniting with the team intentionally or getting blasted by the S.B.'s.
Eventually, they spill out into the PSU Briefing Center.
'p/soof THREE; YOUR JOB, SHOUIO You WOSE HOT To BE EXECUTES _
At the beginning ofthe scene, the Troubleshooters, hopefully running from the Scrubot brigade, end up in the PSU Briefing Center. They must find the correct briefing room and their assignments, post haste.
if PSU CENTER TOR PEREORMWG TROUBLESHOOTERS
There are, literally, thousands of clones in the PSU Briefing Center when the Troubleshooters arrive. Most ofthem are Infrared clones trying to perform menial tasks (running errands, cleaning up, getting in the way ofthe Troubleshooters, etc.), but a few are high clearance clones attached to one of Alpha Complex's Service Groups.
JYou see, the PSU Briefing Center is also the liaison HQ forPSU Sector Troubleshooters I and all other Service Groups. Every Service Group has a small office (more like a stafcri) as well as a staff of representatives and workers (who don't all fit in the offices)
I and it seems every clone in PSU sector got there early today so that they could get their bmtrss done. The following are a few examples of what is going on. 
HPD&MC
Housing Preservation and Development and Mind Control is terribly overburdened. It seems that the Computer, in Its infinite capacity, has started assigning quadruple the normal number of clones to PSU sector and It expects PSU HPD&MC to find places for all of them to live.
HPD is rising to the challenge. It has turned bunk beds into quads, single creches into octasleepers, and corridors into "special assignment camping maneuvers." Anyone who shows up near the HPD&MC booth is handed a long form they can use for detailing their current housing requirements and listing their current address.
The Troubleshooters are currently living in the creches or dormitories they came from — fairly comfortable, and definitely the best Red clearance has to offer. However, if anyone looks over the form carefully (i.e., they actually read it), they will be able to determine that even the most basic forgery attempt could garner the Troubleshooter quarters fit for an Indigo.
For many Troubleshooters, this will be too good an opportunity to pass up. Ifthey bull through the crowd, form clutched in hand, they can attempt to turn it in to the harried, Orange clearance clone named Hell-O-GRL-4 at the desk. She will then stuff it into a box and send it offfor processing. Presumably, the Troubleshooter will then be assigned really great quarters.
At least the first time.
The second time anyone tries this, a Violet level clone named Rowe-V-WAD-5 (the local head ofHPD&MC) will snatch the form out ofthe clerk's hand and read it over, frowning. He will then demand to know whose form this is, why they filled it out the way they did, and all manner of other personal information. When he gets to the information about where the clone is living, Roe-V will brighten considerably, and then shake the Troubleshooter's hand.
"Thank you, thank you! We’d forgotten about the extra space we had in Corridor XJC/154! Thank you for reminding us! It’s Red clearance, you say? Good! We have hundreds of Red clearance clones in desperate need of housing! Tonightcycle, you’ll have a few extra roommates! And don’t worry—we’ll make sure everyone in your dorm knows who the housing hero is!"
The Violet clone then chuckles and moves on. Nothing the Troubleshooter does can change this outcome.
Тне ARM£D fORces tVAA/т YOU!
The Armed Forces are on a recruiting drive. Normally, the Computer assigns clones to a particular Service Group and, unless they volunteer for the Troubleshooters or get involuntarily transferred, that's that. But PSU sector Armed Forces have been given permission to recruit in the sector (possibly due to the overcrowding that's going on). They are looking for volunteers.
Anyone passing by the Armed Forces booth will be grabbed by a pair of really large clones. Large, well-armed clones. It would be Really Bad to resist, you tell the player. These guys look like they could break you in two without thinking about it. In fact, they'd probably have to, since their brains are about the size ofwalnuts (those are nuts used to screw into ceilingbolts, you think). They lead the Troubleshooter to their booth, where he is yelled at by a drill sergeant named Shwartz-I-KOF-3.
"All right, you vat-scum! You think you’ve got what it takes to make it in the Armed Forces? Well, here’s where we find out! Give this dirt-bag a weapon, soldier!"
At this point, one of the goons thrusts a laser rifle into the hands of the bewildered clone.
"Well, what are you waiting for?" the drill sergeant screams, "Pick a target and start firing!" The drill sergeant points downrange at a pair of infrared clones dressed up in strange outfits. One is wearing a large, fuzzy hat and drooping plastic moustache, while the other has a large, sponge-rubber cos¬tume that makes it look like a monster.
If the Troubleshooter hesitates, maybe he's in the wrong line of work—the sergeant calls for another volunteer. Otherwise, he can start blazing away with the laser rifle (damage value 9L) at the uarmored, unarmed clones. The clones have Agility attributes of4, so they should be easy targets. The laser rifle has six shots, so this should be a slaughter. 
After the weapon has been emptied or the two clones are incapacitated, the sergeant calls for another volunteer. He does not collect the laser rifle from the clone and will allow the Troubleshooter to walk off with it (the sergeant is actually a member of Death Leopard, and he wants to supply weapons to the people).
If any bright Troubleshooter volunteers, the two goons grab the clone, strap one ofthe "funny" mutant or Commie outfits on him, and hurl him downrange. The next thing he hears is "Fire!" and a bunch of laser blasts head his way. If he can keep from being fried (there are three attackers with laser rifles, all have pitiful skill values of 5) after six total shots, the drill sergeant will scream, "That's the stuff," award him a service volunteer badge, and send him on his way.
OTHER FHCOUHTERS
Other encounters in the mall area ofPSU are along similar lines. Other Service Groups are represented, and there are Commies, mutants, traitors, spies, secret society agents, and all manner of clones in the area. Occasional explosions rock the place, and Crazy Eddies are everywhere, hawking their wares. Run a few encounters until just before it gets dull.
fWDWG THE BRfFFWG ROOM
When the T roubleshooters have wandered around for a little bit, presumably in search of the Briefing Room, they eventually hear an announcement.
"Attention, Citizens! This is the Computer! I regret to inform you that there are possible traitors in PSU sector! They are Troubleshooters, and they are late for a briefing! They are supposed to report to Briefing Room RUAOK immedi¬ately!"
At this point, a sign begins blinking over the entrance to Briefing Room RUAOK, just on the other side ofthe mall area.
"If they do not report within the next two minutecycles, they are in violation
of their orders and due to be terminated. Here are their pictures for reference."
Photos ofthe Troubleshooters begin flashing on a giant monitor screen, one at a time. Pick each Troubleshooter at random. As soon as one is picked, someone in the crowd yells, "Hey, there he/she is! Get him/her!" and clones surge forward. You see, it is well known that the best way up the ladder is to knock someone else offtheir rung.
Basically, the longer the Troubleshooters hesitate, the more of them will get over¬whelmed by the mob. Anyone who didn't start running for RUAOK as soon as the light lit up stands a good chance of getting grabbed. Everyone else should make it.
If even one Troubleshooter makes it to RUAOK, then everyone is considered to have made it — at least as far as the Computer is concerned. Clone replacements (for those ripped up by the mob) will show up at the briefing room. When everyone is there, the briefing begins.
BMG BRfFFFD
The briefing is held in a small, dark room with no apparent furnishings. When the Troubleshooters are all there, a group of hot lights blink on, focusing on their faces. No matter how they try, they cannot shield themselves from the lights' glare. Suddenly, a
voice booms out:
"Are you T roubleshooter team Alpha- Alpha-Omega-ST" the voice shouts. The sound reverberates in your heads. Your throats feel dry and cracked as you try to answer.
Allow the team members to answer. Don't worry, no answer is the correct one. Ifthey say "yes," then they will be grilled:
"How did you know your classification, citizens? The classification of all
Troubleshooter teams is security clearance Yellow!"
If they say "no," they will be screamed at:
"What do you mean you aren’t team AAO3? IF you aren’t, then why are you here? Are you Commie spies sent to infiltrate a secret mission breifing?"
Ifthey say "we don't know" or anything similar, they will be admonished: 
"What do you mean you don’t know?! You are —” and the voice reads each of your names off in turn — "and you are here, aren’t you? And we’re supposed to be briefing team AAO3 at this time! Are you suggesting we are in error?"
And so on.
This briefing officer, Claud-I-USS-6, is a very nervous, very suspicious clone trans¬ferred to the Troubleshooters out of Power Services. He believes that every Trouble¬shooter team has been sent to him in an effort to discredit him and get him executed for incompetence. As a result, he hates performing briefings, and will give out as little information as possible—he hopes that the Troubleshooters will fail in whatever mission they are assigned as soon as possible, so that they will be blamed and not him. If possible, he will stir up paranoia among the group, and try to get them to attack or discredit each other.
The next voice the Troubleshooters hear does not start until Claud-I stops his play. It is a low, sultry (well, it would sound sultry ifnot for all those hormone suppressants) voice — a pleasant contrast to Claud-I's bellowing. It is the voice of Lauren-B-CAL-4, an Internal Security agent assigned to make sure all briefing procedures are followed to the letter.
"Now, now, Claud-I, don’t get excited. I’m sure these Troubleshooters are ready to be briefed on their mission, aren’t they? Good. And we’ll be happy to do that, won’t we? Excellent. Now, who is the Team Leader?"
Anyone who steps forward is hereby assigned leadership ofthe team. Ifmore than one Troubleshooter wants the honor, Lauren-B will chuckle, low in her throat, and suggest that the two clones "settle this" between themselves. Right now.
Lauren-B is really watching to see who will be the first to disrupt the briefing. Anyone who throws the first "punch" will be reprimanded by her in a sharp, shrill voice and assigned a wad of treason points. Anyone who tries to stop the disruption will not be helped or even congratulated, but Lauren-B will remember it.
Eventually, Lauren-B will laugh again and her voice will return to its sultry tones. She will either choose a Team Leader randomly or pick the one clone who everyone else yielded to.
"Well, Citizen, you have your work cut out for you. You are going to be sent after treason in its highest form — a Troubleshooter team gone bad."
Lauren will then proceed to tell the Troubleshooters some of the story of the original team — she will definitely reveal that a Troubleshooter team was sent out some monthcycles ago to explore a "far away sector." She might reveal it as the Outdoors, ifyou want to, or she might keep that tidbit of information a secret. She will give the Team Leader a small vid-crystal he can use with the team's recorder (which they will be assigned later) to view the Troubleshooters' targets and learn some basic information about them.
After that, Lauren-B will choose a Loyalty Officer for the group — if possible, she'll pick the clone who tried to settle things in the dispute over team leadership, but, ifnot, she'll pick someone everyone else is most likely to dislike anyway. She will also assign any other Mandatory Bonus Duty you think appropriate for the session (Equipment Guy, Commu¬nications Officer, Morale Officer, etc.) to the rest ofthe team. Then she'll pass the rest of the briefing off to Sad-R-ATT-3.
Sad-R, a Troubleshooter from R&D, is the only clone in the group who has actually been Outdoors, and it has affected him. He does not want to be a briefing officer, and he really doesn't want to talk about the Outdoors. When he was Sad-R-ATT-1, he was sent into the Outdoors on a mission and, despite encountering hostile natives, giant mutant radioac¬tive slugs, and all manner of other dangers (not to mention drug withdrawal and hormone explosion), he returned. He lost his two clones in Alpha Complex during his debriefing (for revealing knowledge of information above his clearance).
However, Lauren-B will force Sad-R to brief the Troubleshooters on the Outdoors (unless you think it would be fun not to) and to answer their most penetrating questions. She will also take notes on the team's knowledge or curiosity about things above their clearance, but she will not do anything about it now.
Sad-R, when pressed, knows the following information:
•	The Outdoors has no ceiling.
•	The Outdoors is very dirty.
•	There are clones and mutants in the Outdoors.
•	There are giant bots in the Outdoors of fearful construction. 
•	The old team is still alive Outdoors, and he can give you general directions on where to look.
•	The Computer can replace clones Outdoors, but only ifyou call in for replacements.
•	The Computer does not monitor Outdoors.
•	There are no food dispensers Outdoors.
Unfortunately, Sad-R will only respond if questioned about specifics — and specific questions are going to get the Troubleshooters in trouble eventually. Give out as much or as little ofthis information as you want.
One way of controlling the amount of information passed along is through Sad-R's attrition rate. Every time he answers two questions accurately about the Outdoors, he is executed for displaying knowledge above his security clearance. But he keeps answering, at Lauren-B's bidding, until out of his six pack. This should be some indication to the audience that Lauren-B is much more scary to Sad-R than final termination. Wise Troubleshooters will make note of it.
When the Troubleshooters have had as much oftheir questions answered as you deem necessary, they are told to report to PLC for equipment assignment. Just as they are about to resign themselves to another exasperating search through Alpha Complex, a door opens up in one of the room's walls, and they are directed through.
iPtsooe FOUR; fs rr ме, OR PLC?
A stop at PLC is always profitable. The Computer says so, and It wouldn't lie to you, would it? No, of course not.
The Troubleshooters are introduced, either by Sad-R-ATT or Lauren-B-CAL, to Scav- I-GER, the local authority in PSU's Production, Logistics, and Commissary division. It is his duty, and his pleasure, to outfit the clones for the mission.
"Well, hello there,” the friendly-looking Indigo clone says, 'Tm Scav-I-GER- 3, local head ofPLC. And what can I do for you today?"
Ifnobodyjumps in, the Troubleshooter's escort introduces the team and explains that they are to be assigned equipment for Troubleshooter Retrieval Mission Zed-Zed-Alpha- Zed and that Scav-I-GER is to handle the assignments personally. There have been reports of unauthorized equipment leaking out ofPLC, and the Computer wants to make sure that everything is assigned properly. The escort then hands Scav-I-GER a list ofthe equipment to be assigned, and walks out.
If an alert Troubleshooter wants to try, he can make aperception check to read the list as it is passed to the PLC clone. The list has the following items on it:
•	1 Laser pistol per Troubleshooter
•	2 Laser barrels (Red) per Troubleshooter
•	1 Laser rifle, assigned to a Troubleshooter ofthe Team Leader's choice, with 2 extra laser barrels (Red)
•	1 suit of reflec armor (Red L4) per Troubleshooter
•	1 suit of kevlar armor (B3), to be assigned to a Troubleshooter of the Team Leader's choice
•	1 cannister of Alpha Complex drug supplements, assigned to the Morale Officer
•	1 tool kit, assigned to the Equipment Guy
•	1 medkit, assigned to a Troubleshooter of the Team Leader's choice
•	1 Multicorder I, assigned to the Communications Officer
•	1 Com I per Troubleshooter
•	1 Com II, assigned to a Troubleshooter of the Team Leader's choice
•	2 weekcycles worth ofrations (including cans of Bouncy Bubble Beverage, Algae Chips, and FunTyme CheeseLyke Substance) per Troubleshooter
The difficulty level ofthe perception check is Easy. For every point the die roll exceeds the check number by, let the alert Troubleshooter see one random item offthe list.
This proves to be important as there is a leak ofequipment going on in PSU PLC—and it is coming from Scav-I-GER himself. 
Scav-I-GER is a member of the Pro Tech secret society, and he has been trying like crazy to "technify" the masses. Basically, he's been handing out gobs of equipment to anyone he can, and falsifying requisition forms and damage reports. Unfortunately, the Computer has started to catch on, and Scav-I is a little worried. So, in order to make up for some shortages, he is going to assign the Troubleshooters some "alternate" equipment (ifhe can get away with it). Here's the new list:
•	Everyone still gets a laser pistol, but one ofthe pistols (chosen at random) is defective and will only fire one burst, draining all the ammunition from the currently loaded barrel. The damage value ofthe discharge is 15, but the barrel will melt, making the laser pistol worthless after one shot.
•	Everyone gets one laser barrel.
•	The laser rifle is, strangely, exchanged with a cone rifle. Instead of two extra laser barrels, the Troubleshooter will receive two rounds of Dum-Dum ammo (damage value 15P).
•	Only half the team (round up) receives Reflec armor, but one team member actually receives Blue clearance armor that has been painted Red.
•	No kevlar armor is assigned.
•	The drug supplements are CrunchyYum Candies, that have little effect except as a sugar supplement.
•	The tool kit is woefully incomplete — there's a hammer, some duct tape , and a really dull knife that will snap at the first use.
•	The medkit is actually a Teela O'Malley lunchbox with "Teela O'Malley" scratched out and "Medkit" scrawled on it in black ink. However, inside there are bandages, drugs, and other supplies that give the Troubleshooter +3 to all first aid rolls.
•	The Multicorder I works fine. It really works fine. You see, the Computer modified it so that it broadcasts a continual video feed back to Alpha Complex regardless of whether it is "on" or not. Any Troubleshooter who makes an easy check using the mechanical or electronics skill will figure this out. The difficulty is normal to disarm this feature (though that might be treason, unless explained very well).
•	No Com Is will be assigned.
•	The Com II is the team's only contact with the Computer while they are Outdoors (that they know of). It has an increasing chance offritzing out permanently every time it is used. The chance starts at one-in-ten and increases by one every time it is used.
•	The rations are a bagged lunch for everyone — about a daycycle's worth.
If Scav-I-GER is confronted by someone who sees his list about missing items, he will first deny it, then he will offer the Troubleshooters "surplus" equipment as a replacement and, finally, he will grow hostile and remind them that he is an Indigo clearance clone and they are lowly Reds and they should be glad he doesn'tjust have them executed for giving him a hard time.
Ifthe Troubleshooters are canny and don't threaten Scav-I about going to the Computer (at least not much), they can get all kinds ofneat stuff out ofhim. Grenades, slugthrowers, and other weapons are available, but foodstuffs (which he used to trade for neat gizmos he then distributed) and drugs are not. Some armor can be had, though most of it is flawed.
Ifthere is a Pro Tech member in the party, and Scav-I finds out, he will make sure that clone gets a few "extras" and the best of any equipment to be had.
Should the team give Scav-I-GER a really hard time, he has some Armed Forces guards on loan that will make sure nobody messes with him again. The Computer will be on his side, no matter what the Troubleshooters say ("What do you mean you saw a list of equipment you are to be assigned? Don't you realize that list is Indigo clearance? ZAP!") and they will end up the worse for it.
After the PLC encounter has run its course, ship the team off to R&D.
ёр/sooe fm: A/о GOOD Еашрмемт Goes
Vt/PMfSHeo
Next door is the PSU Research and Design Testing and Distribution Center — not necessarily in that order. The Troubleshooters have bravely volunteered to test some new 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
equipment for the Computer in the terrible Outdoors. They will be assigned gear by trained R&D techs led by Madas-O-HTR.
That's right—the current head ofPSU's R&D is only Orange clearance. Due to a small testing accident, several clones were promoted quickly to fill the void. As a result PSU's R&D staff is not cleared to know much, if anything, about the stuff they will be distributing. This makes all those question and answer sessions pretty easy to run:
Troubleshooter: So, what's it do?
Madas-O: Beats me.
TS: Really?!
Madas-O: No. I mean, I have no idea.
TS: Youjust strapped it on my back and turned it on?! It's humming and glowing! What do you mean you don't know what it does?!
Madas-O: (Stepping away quickly) Hey, I wasn't cleared for that information.
Fortunately, you know what's being assigned:
• Multilateral Surveillance Pack and Gravitudinal Locator Device: It looks like a big Multicorder pack with speakers and antennae. Madas-O thinks that's what it is. He tells the Troubleshooter the MulSurPak is assigned to that, in order to communicate with the rest ofthe team, he needs to hold a detachable microphone in his hand and speak into it. This results in the Troubleshooter's voice being amplified nearly 100 times and blasted out ofthe pack's speakers. In order to use the pack to locate Alpha Complex, other team members, or other terrain features in the Outdoors, simply press another hand-held button—but, in order to assure a safe test environment, the MulSurPak will not be armed until the Troubleshooter is outside.
Gamemaster Note: This feature of the MulSurPak should surprise the Trouble¬shooter. It actually works — sort of. When the locator feature is activated, the MulSurPak turns into a jetpack, shooting the Troubleshooter into the air at rocket speed. The MulSurPak will also spin the Troubleshooter in the air, so that the wearer gets a good look around. Unfortunately, the spinning is so fast it will make just about anyone sick. The 

 


















 
MulSurPak then deploys a parachute, allowing the Troubleshooter to land safely (yes, it works). Of course, if there is any wind at all, the Troubleshooter will drift hundreds of meters away from his original launch position.
•	Mini-Computer AdvisoBot: When activated, this small jackobot speaks with the tone and authority of the Computer. It had its personality downloaded from PSU's local node, and it is supposed to be the team's guide in the wilderness — that is, it's supposed to keep them out of trouble.
Gamemaster Note: The M-CAB is not what it appears to be. "TreasonBot" would probably be a better term for this little monster. Inside Alpha Complex, it will act like a miniature version of the Computer — barking orders, assuming authority, and repri¬manding treasonous behavior. However, the M-CAB is suffering from separation anxiety. It resents the fact that it (It?) doesn't have any lasers or grapplers to eliminate traitors with, and it feels neglected and betrayed. As a result, it acts like an adolescent dictator
•	it will try to force the Troubleshooters to do treasonous and dangerous things, using its Computer-like personality to browbeat them into compliance. If this behavior is brought to the attention of the Computer, the Computer will act like a parent... It will deny that M- CAB is in any way at fault and blame the Troubleshooters for any problems that occur.
Troubleshooter: Hey, up ahead. I see a group ofnaked clones sitting around a fire. They look peaceful, if dirty. Let's go talk to them.
M-CAB: No! The Computer says you must attack! Leave no traitors unbaked! Fry them all! Troubleshooter: Oh, shut up. We attacked the last three groups of clones we've run into, that big, brown, fanged bot we ran into in that dark corridor, and a rock, all on your say-so.
We've cycled through half our six-packs, and I'm sick of it.
M-CAB: Treason! I am the Computer! You will obey! Exterminate!
Troubleshooter: Go stuff your diodes in a magnetic field.
M-CAB: (Using hidden speakers, the M-CAB starts broadcasting recordings of laser fire, screams, bear growls —from the "big, brown, fanged bot" — and all sorts of clatter. The Outdoors "clones" respond byjumping up, shouting a lot, and arming themselves. Seeing the Troubleshoot¬ers, they attack.)
Troubleshooter: You tin-plated idiot! Look what you did! Now we have to fight!
M-CAB: That's better. Serve the Computer (Scoots out of harm's way.)
•	Non-Ceiling Response Units: These look like two very heavy boots. In actuality, they are lead-weighted boots designed to keep Troubleshooters from floating away from the floor while Outdoors (hey, gravity could fail, right?). They are not necessary in Alpha Complex, since there are ceilings to catch the Troubleshooter should that occur indoors.
Gamemaster Note: These boots have two game effects. First, they will reduce a character's Agility and Agility skill base by one-halfwhile they are worn (and they are to be worn at all times while Outdoors). Second, unless the Troubleshooter obviously doubts the Computer's wisdom (shame!), they will instill great confidence in the Troubleshooter when he ventures Outdoors. While everyone else is clinging to brown poles and grey lumps and screaming at the lack of ceiling, this Troubleshooter will clunk around confidently. Of course, he won't be really able to get out of the way of attacks ...
•	Bottled Troubleshooter Emergency Cavalry Hydraulic suit: The B-TECH suit is to be worn by a Troubleshooter. It is an advanced type ofpowered armor designed to make any Troubleshooter a walking arsenal. When worn, it covers the clone completely, with no obvious weak points.
Gamemaster Note: The B-TECH suit is a breakthrough in clone-bot interface technology. The clone wears the suit, which is really a "dumbot" encased in the layers of the A115 armor. The dumbot assists the clone in moving, using weapons, and operating interior systems.
There are several weapons mounted in and around the B-TECH suit, including two laser pistols (mounted in hands), a laser rifle (shoulder mount), a cone rifle with HEAT rounds (other shoulder), and the clone receives +3 to his HTH bonus in hand-to-hand combat.
There are some drawbacks, however. For one thing, moving around in the B-TECH is difficult. The character must make an Agility check to perform many normally simple actions. Here are some examples of difficulty levels:
•	Climbing a slope: Easy
•	Jogging: Easy
•	Jumping: Normal
•	Climbing: Tough 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
Another drawback involves the air conditioning system: there isn't one. The B-TECH suit was designed using the most advanced systems and motors in Alpha Complex, but nobody every figured out how to pour antifreeze into a few select pouch areas.
As a result, any strenuous activity will cause the wearer to get really warm and fatigued quickly. Actually firing weapons will cause damage to the wearer. Start at a base damage value of zero when a weapon is fired. Every additional weapon firing causes an additional point to be added to the damage value. So, ifthe Troubleshooter fires, say, his laser rifle, he is instantly hit by a damage value OE attack (0+ldlO damage). When he fires another weapon (maybe the cone rifle), the damage value goes up to IE. As a result, a B- TECH operator can cook himself inside his armor during a "heated" exchange.
The B-TECH armor cools down at a rate of one point per round of complete rest. So, the wearer continues to take damage until the B-TECH has cooled to zero. Getting out ofthe armor, or into it for that matter, takes about three rounds.
RAFT: The Really Aerodynamic Floating Transport is actually a rubber raft with with a few extra gizmos. The Troubleshooters know how to inflate it (pull this cord) but not how to work any of the other gizmos.
Gamemaster Note: The following gizmos are attached to the RAFT:
•	Red Button: Emergency Braking Thrusters. Push this button and jets fire from under¬neath the RAFT, capsizing it.
•	Blue Button: Forward Thrusters. This one fires jet assists from the rear of the craft, capsizing it.
•	Black Lever: Manual Motivational Devices. Oars appear, slip off into the water, and the Troubleshooters probably capsize the RAFT as they grab for them.
•	Silver Lever: Hydraulic Rudder Control. A rudder appears in the back ofthe RAFT, but it is extremely sensitive. Unless care is used in steering the craft, it will capsize.
•	Red Toggles: Floodlights. Lights come out of the RAFTs sides, illuminating the shorelines on both sides, the sky, and both fore and aft. I can't think of a way for this to cause the RAFT to capsize, but give it a try.
•	Blue Patch: Deflation Control. Pull this, and the air comes out ofthe RAFT, causing it to sink. Of course, sticking something sharp in any part of the RAFT will do this as well.
Anything else you want to assign the Troubleshooters is fine. Use the R&D equipment listed in this book as a beginning, and come up with any wacky, strange, or dangerous piece ofstuffthe Troubleshooters can lug into the Outdoors. Try to think like someone who has never seen the Outdoors and only heard very little about it, and try to anticipate possible problems.
After R&D equipment has been assigned, Madas tells the Troubleshooters that they are to report to PSU sector transtube and immediately board the transbot for OUT sector. OUT sector is where the hatch leading to the Outdoors is (at least one ofthem), and they have to go there immediately.
Sp/sooe Six: Ox rue Tiwsruee AND Our me DOOR
The T roubleshooters make it to the transbotj ust as it is leaving, cramming their bodies into the transbot cars as the doors shut behind (or on) them. Think of a subway at rush hour. Then think of a subway at rush hour with heavily armed people shoving as many other people as they can fit into the trams — this is what Alpha Complex mass transit is like.
If at all possible, the Troubleshooters should be separated. They don't have to worry about getting offin time — OUT sector is the very last stop there is on the line. But, this way, they might be able to do a few things in private.
Reo CifAMWce ТйеАттмт
Being Red Clearance, the Troubleshooters out-rank many ofthe clones on the transbot. They are still packed in like ammo in a clip, but they can throw their weight around (if they can get some leverage). They can force Infrareds to hang from the ceiling or get out of seats or let go ofhandholds. This is important — the transbot is veryj erky and moves very fast. Anyone not holding onto anything or sitting in a seat takes damage value 5B 
every so often as the transtube nearly leaves the track, halts suddenly, or bounces. Anyone holding onto a handbar or hook only takes damage value 3B, while those in seats take no damage. While even 5B plus IdlO only results in minor bruises (unless the Troubleshooter is really wimpy), it is uncomfortable.
Every Troubleshooter should have a good view, however, of higher-clearance cars. There are Orange, Y ellow, and even Green clearance trams along the train, all within easy access. None of them are nearly as crowded — some are almost empty.
If a Troubleshooter wants to bull his way to a higher clearance car, he can do so easily. The Infrareds will immediately perceive Something Bad is Happening and get out of the way (as much as they can). They will let the Troubleshooter get to the door.
Upon entering a higher clearance car, nothing happens. Nothing at all. A few higher clearance clones may frown in the Troubleshooter's direction, but they are not going to start anything — remember, the Troubleshooters are fairly well armed, and most of the other clones are unarmed or only carrying lasers. Besides, they know Somebody Else will deal with it.
Someoov itse
"Somebody Else" arrives soon after every Troubleshooter who is going to shift cars does so — use yourjudgment. Somebody Else arrives a few minutecycles after the Trouble¬shooter has gotten settled, and can be in any of the following forms:
•	Conduc-I-TOR-4: This squirrely little clone is in charge of the PSU transtube OUT sector run. He wears his crisp, Indigo conductor's uniform with pride. He also wears a yellow stripe on his outfit — the sign of a registered mutant.
Conduc-I-TOR-1!
Mutant Power: Telekinesis Secret Society: Assemblers ofGod Service Group: Power Services S8 A6 C9 D7 E7 MAS M7 P10 Macho: 3 Wounds: 5 HTH: 4
Brawling 7, dodge 8, intimidation 10, perception 6, laser pistols 9, transbot ops and maintenance 12, surveillance 8
Equipment: Indigo reflec armor (4L), laser pistol with Indigo ammo (9L), ticket puncher
Description: Conduc-I-TOR started out as a transbot repairclone and has worked his way up from there to a position of power and prestige. He does not take kindly to clones jumping clearance and will indicate strongly that the violator return immediately to the Infrared clearance car. He will also ask the Troubleshooter's name, so he can report it to the Computer. Ifthere is any hesitation at all, he will try using his TK power to throw the Troubleshooter back, or he will use his laser to settle the problem.
•	Big Blue: Big Blue patrols the transtubes much like Conduc-I-TOR, but it isn't interested in security clearance violations. Rather, it is an anti-terrorist bot that uses high-beam scanners to check for bombs, explosives, or electronic surveillance equipment. It will go up to each clone in the car, scan them, and move on. If the clone is of Orange or higher clearance, it can avoid this scan by pulling rank — someone thought it would be a good idea to tell Big Blue not to scan anyone of a certain level if they didn't want to be. This means Big Blue is often very frustrated, because it can't fit in the Infrared clearance cars and must go throughout the other cars pleading, "Scan, sir?" and being rejected.
But the Troubleshooters are only ofRed clearance, aren't they? Big Blue will be happy to see them and, as it trundles up to each clone, it will happily exclaim: "Magnetic scanning for terrorist equipment underway!" It will then start emiting a high-frequency buzz at the Troubleshooter.
The Troubleshooter then takes 8E damage from the radiation — Big Blue isn't supposed to cause damage, but it is a little overenthusiastic. It will also pinpoint any computer or bot software on the Troubleshooter, and start reporting it. Then Big Blue will "neutralize" each piece with a magnet burst.
As a result, anyone with any equipment scanned by Big Blue will be affected. Laser firing chips will be scrambled, bots will be glitched, and general havok will ensue. Big Blue does a poorjob of eliminating all the threats (everything still works), but it will do a good job of screwing things up (everything is now much more prone to malfunction).
Gamemaster, make a note of any Troubleshooters scanned by Big Blue. Whenever they use any equipment that could have had a chip in it (just about everything, nowadaycycles), 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
there is a chance of partial or com¬plete malfunction.
In addition to these two threats, you can have others patrolling the cars. Maybe a pair of large Yellow clones take exception to a Red clone in their car. They get up, after a while, and start to abuse the Troubleshooter, who can do nothing because the Com¬puter will be summoned if he causes trouble. The Yellows won't be satis¬fied just sending the Troubleshooter back where he came from — they'll bully and embarrass the clone until he is very sorry he showed up.
Be inventive and sadistic with these ideas, and feel free to punish the vio¬lators. After all, they're breaking the rules, aren't they?
TkAW WRECK!
In the midst of all this, the transtube wrecks. Everyone takes some damage, as the transbot slams into something lying on the track. It might have been another transbot, something that crawled out from the bowels ofAlpha Complex, or anything else big and destructive. We can call it "Bot Ex Machina," if you want.
The Computer's voice comes over the speakers:
"Attention all clones on PSU sector transbot. All clones are hereby ordered to leave the transbot and proceed back to PSU station immediately, while the transbot is being repaired.
"All clones, that is, except" — and the Computer reads offyour names." They are on a super-secret mission for Me, and they are to continue on along the tracks. Under no circumstances are these clones" — and the Troubleshooters' faces are flashed, one after another, on a vidscreen for all to see — "to be interfered with. Even though there are no security cameras in the transtube all the way to OUT sector, I expect no treason to be going on. Thank you for your cooperation."
While this declaration should fill the Troubleshooter team with great confidence, there is probably something unsavory in the glares they are getting from their fellow clones. Do you think there could be traitors on the train? Of course not!
Well, maybe we should get moving quickly anyway.
A LONG WALK
There are all kinds of dangers in the bowels ofAlpha Complex — mutants, renegade traitors, wild, dangerous bots, and Things That Crawled From the Vats. The Trouble¬shooters will hear squeaks and squeals and thumps until they are blazing away into the darkness. They may even hear the rumblings of transbots approaching and fight each other for the single emergency platforms they are near (room for only one clone), only to hear the transbot streak by above or below their tube.
Eventually, the clones will grow tired ofwalking and start spreading out. Whether they say so or not, they will. Don't let them give you any "marching order" crap, either—Alpha Complex clones aren't heroes or in great physical shape. While they can run and scream with the best ofthem, marching isn't their strong point, and neither is discipline. Ifyou 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
say, "Numb-R-ONE is in the back of the party," he is — he got bored "marching flank at exactly four meters out and two up, scanning each way for hostiles while sending back warning signals every two minutes." No matter what they say, they're going to start scratching themselves, lingering, and generally being undisciplined.
CONTACTf
So, at the appropriate moment, hands come out and grab one of them from behind. Which one? Doesn't matter to me, but it might to you. See, some of the clones on the transtube were in Secret Societies (go figure) and they have reported seeing members of their societies on a "very important Computer mission." They were told to make contact and assign secret society missions and provide assistance if possible. Check out the "Secret Society Missions" sidebar for some suggestions.

Finally, the Troubleshooters exit the transtube line in OUT sector. They are met by a group ofVulture Troopers who see less-than-amused by their lack of promptness. They are berated by the VT leader, John Cloud-V-DAM-2, who will beat the snot out of anyone who offers any excuse for their lateness other that "we're sorry, sir, it will never happen again."
Jean Cloud and his VT Troopers hustle the Troubleshooters offto the airlock (the VT Troopers seem a little odd — their helmets cover their faces, but actually show outlines oftheir features. When they talk, it is very disconcerting, because their "mouths" don't move. Of course, since their vocabulary consists of "Get moving" and "Vat scum," that isn't really noticeable).
Jean Cloud will bitch and moan about having to escort the Troubleshooters. He's upset about being assigned "Junior Citizen-sitting duty instead ofbeing allowed to kick traitor butt!" as he puts it. His men feel the same way. At the least provocation, they will beat the living sucrose out of the Troubleshooters.
Don't worry about their stats; they're way tougher than the Troubleshooters, but they won't kill them. They'll just jump around like maniacs, kicking and yelling, until the Computer comes on and tells them to get with the program.
Tki A/RLOCK
The airlock is a giant iris valve in the middle of a large, steel-reinforced wall. The VT Troopers flank the iris and the Troubleshooters stand in front of it. Jean Cloud triggers the release.
The iris valve opens with a rasp. Air from Outdoors rushes in. Y ou inhale and cough. It tears at your lungs and freezes your bones! There’s something ... missing... in it. No overpowering smells, no chlorogens, probably not even any background radiation. Ick! Do we get gas masks?
The Computer’s voice comes over a hidden speaker. "Now, Troubleshooters, is the moment you have waited for. Go forth, and find the traitors in the Outdoors. Return only when you have succeeded in your mission. You who are about to die, salute me!"
That last bit is hardly encouraging, but the Troubleshooters have no choice. When they recover from their coughing fit and blinking at the light from Outdoors, they have to go through the airlock. Some will probably hesitate (they should; it's scary out there), others will try to escape. No one should go too willingly, even Seal Clubbers who thought they knew what to expect.
Eventually, they all get booted out.
ip/sooe SIGHT: TO Seen OUT, TO Sxptope „ To POUR Smpornp Donww/Gi „
Tfte game runs a little amerentiy uutaoors. uy now, tne players should have a little bit of a handle on Alpha Complex, so they should be able to roleplay in the Outdoors without too many problems and a few reminders. Here's a glossary of terms that might help you out: 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY...
Sky: Blue dome, impossibly high in the air. Scary.
Changes in color, possibly because ofthat big light fixture (see "Sun," below). There are white, fluffy things in it — maybe some pollution.
Sun: Dome light, again, very high up. It seems to move slowly across the top ofthe dome. Seems to emanate heat as well. Get out the Geiger counter — probably heavily radio¬active. Hey, it's gone out! Jeez, it's cold! Hope that they fix it soon.
Ground: Floor, very dirty and patchy. Everything's covered with this green, spongy stuff. Ick. I think I saw some ofthat growing on my Imitation SoyBurger last weekcycle in the commissary. Maybe we can eat it.
Tree: Brownpoles, covered with more green stuff. Maybe these are communications networks. Yeah, that's it—plug the Com into one and see what we can hear.
Wildlife: Bots, m utants are everywhere. Look out! There's a small, brown one with a grenade. Zap! Got it! Hey, it looks like it was eating the grenade ... and, look, over here! A whole bunch of these tiny grenades attached to a brown pole! Let's get some!
Natives: Dirty, smelly, clones I mutants I traitors carry¬ing pointy long objects and bludgeons are everywhere. Hey, some of them have hair on their faces ... and everywhere else. Yuck! Haven't they ever heard ofhormone suppressants! Eeeuck! What are those two doing?! I guess they haven’t...
Everything else in the Outdoors should be converted to Alpha Complex-speak. Try not to let the players get away with calling a tree a tree, a rock a rock, or a giant radioactive cockroach a giant radioactive cockroach. The name is the thing — ifthey start calling things by their descriptions, they'll start thinking that way as well.
OTHER PROBLEMS W THE OUTDOORS
Some ofthese problems will manifest themselves immediately, others will take a little longer.
WEATHER
Whoever is supposed to be climate controlling this dome is doing a... surprisingly good job. In Alpha Complex, temperature changes are random and extreme (remember that temperature drop in ICE sector? Froze my tongue to my BBB can!); in the Outdoors, temperatures are a mild thirty-five degrees Celsius with changes coming in fairly small increments. Unless something goes wrong.
See, whatever caused the Big Oops affected the weather patterns — especially near Alpha Complex. Whenever you think a change in the weather might be fun, roll on the Instant Weather Chart.
The farther away from Alpha Complex the Troubleshooters go, the less likely these erratic "weather patterns" are going to show up. Funny how that works.
GRAMS
GRAMs are "Giant Radio Active Monsters," and they inhabit the Outdoors and feed off any hapless clones and animals they can catch. Most of them, ironically, were not caused by radioactive fallout from the Big Oops but, rather, obtained their large dimensions and strange powers from feeding too near Alpha Complex's coolant disposal units.
To create a GRAM for your Troubleshooters to encounter, simply roll on the GRAM Charts One and Two. Roll on the first chart three times to determine the type of "Critter" the GRAM is descended from, the "Attack Type (Skill Value)" of the creature, and the "Number Appearing." 




































 
The Computer will not interfere with their mission anyway. It is more interested in watching and determining what's so great about Outdoors that anyone would leave Alpha Complex voluntarily.
Tke Л/АГ/WS
This scene ends when the Troubleshooters happen on two groups ofnatives ... excuse me, "Outdoor clones" ... caught in the middle of a battle. They are jumping around, screaming at each other, but not doing much actual damage to each other.
THE CORMET TR/BE
The CorMet tribe is the better-armored of the two groups, wearing metal plates and bot heads and other spare parts from ancient automobiles and crashed flybots. Unfortu¬nately, they are so covered in metal that they are almost completely immobile. The long, pointy things they jab at their enemies almost never find their marks.
The CorMets are normal "clones" with normal attributes. Their spears do 7B damage, and their armor is A113. They are terrible shots with their weapons, and they aren't too good in melee combat either.
THE PSE/DOHS
While these clones have long pointy things, they don't seem to be using them. Instead, they run up near their enemies, grab their foreheads, and grimace hideously. Nothing seems to happen, unless they misjudge their distance and smack into their opponents.
They have the same spears as the CorMets, but won't use them against that tribe. They wear no armor.
WHAT'S Gowe Он
The CorMets and the Pseidons are native followers oftwo ofthe Troubleshooters who came into the Outdoors many monthcycles ago. Dominated by the Troubleshooters' higher technology, they worship their new leaders as gods.
As a result, they follow all their leaders' orders without question. The CorMet leader is a Corpore Metallica clone, and has told his tribe to wear all the metal they can and make "beep-beep" noises like bots. The natives can't tell a bot from a hole in the ground (well, maybe they could), but they're willing to follow along.
The Pseidon leader is a Psion of great power, and he has convinced his followers that the power ofthe mind is the greatest of all—mainly by using his telepathy and TK powers to perform really nasty "miracles." He says that the Pseidons need only wish real hard and their psionic powers will come to the fore. It hasn't happened yet.
THE TROUBLESHOOTERS HAPPEH BY
Both tribes are in a battle against each other, but they have both been warned that Troubleshooters mean trouble. They were told by their leaders that, ifthey saw anyone who looked or dressed like them (presumably another tribal leader), they were to ignore all directives and do their best to kill that person or persons.
Guess what happens now.
The two tribes attack ifthey see the Troubleshooters. The Pseidons use their spears and the CorMets strip offtheir armor. They are fairly formidable, but easily discouraged. They will flee from superior firepower after a few rounds and the Troubleshooters can follow them to the river.
EPtsooc Hwe; A hV/to R/oe
The Troubleshooters should figure out from various clues in the previous scene that the natives are restless for a reason. They may not get the idea that the clones they are hunting have anything to do with them, but, if they don't they're really missing something. Feel free to drop lots of fairly obvious hints (like, maybe, the leader of the CorMet war party has an ID bracelet containing his Troubleshooter leader's picture and name ... subtle things like that).
When confronted by superior firepower, natives break offthe battle and run for it. They head through the woods toward a river. The river is wide, wet, and cold, and the Troubleshooters should be a little intimidated — they haven't see this much water since the Pose-I-DON Adventure vidshow. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. ..
But they have the RAFT. They can inflate it and follow the natives (who have climbed into strange, narrow, floating objects) downstream. Anyone quick enough will notice that the natives are using brown paddle-shaped objects (okay, paddles) to move faster than the water and control their own speed. This might hearten bold Troubleshooters — "Ifthose unwashed savages can do it, so can we!"
Heh.
In the RAFT, the Troubleshooters are quickly swept off downstream. Equipment falls overboard, they are spun about, and everyone probably gets seasick. Anyone who falls overboard has a good chance of drowning ("Swim, what is swim?") or getting smacked by a rock, and steering the RAFT is out of the question.
Oh, let them try. "Make an Agility roll," you say. Nod sagaciously and affirm, "You've nearly got it," or "You think you're on the right track," or "Hey, you must have done something right — it's going faster!"
After a few clones are lost or everyone's scared out of their minds, the RAFT slows a little. A great rumbling is heard, but at least the water's a little more calm. Maybe we can get back to shore. Look, there are the little native boats ...
OHMYGOD — A WATER F

Everyone lose a clone. Replacement clones can be found on the shore underneath the waterfall, along with much of the Troubleshooters' equipment (though much of it is smashed). This is a good way to disarm anyone you want, or dispose of anything they've really gotten good use out of. They might even find a few things they didn't know they had ... it's up to you.
Their replacement clones are, somehow, wet and disheveled (maybe the flybot dropped them in the water) but alive. They are greeted by the ends of many pointy objects. 

 


















 
"Resistance is useless,” someone says. You look up. You get a start as you see more of the unhygienic clones surrounding you. But they aren’t the same clones ... they’re dressed differently and their faces are painted wild colors. They all have an insignia branded into their foreheads.
This is the Clan of the Cave Leopard, and they are led by a Troubleshooter from the Death Leopard secret society. They have captured the Troubleshooters and will escort them to the cave where their leader sits.
Cprsooe Нм: A Mew ПАМ UADSK?
The Outdoors affects everyone differently, as you are no doubt finding out. The Troubleshooters are wet and shocked and probably more than a little panicky. Maybe they are showing signs of drug withdrawal, and they are probably wishing they had some more high tech weaponry about now. They might even be thinking about the Computer. That's what the old Team Leader is doing.
WHAT tf И/е GAVE A WAR AA/D Л/О Оме SHOWED UP?
Hellon-O-WLS-6 has been Outdoors for a few monthcycles now, and she has learned to hate it. At first, she enjoyed the freedom from the Computer and the walls of Alpha Complex. When she took over her own little tribe, she thought she was forming her own little faction of Death Leopard, here, in the wilderness. She could only imagine the terrible havok she could reek on an unsuspecting world.
And that was the problem.
Hellon-O used her warriors to attack other tribes, burn forests, and destroy animals. She thought she was hot stuff. Then a few weather patterns changed. A tornado hit. A hurricane blew in. A blizzard froze the countryside and hot sun beat down on her. And all
in the first weekcycle.
Hellon-O realized that she could never cause destruction or upheaval on that scale. It depressed her. She realized that her only chance to be a Death Leopard again was to go back into Alpha Complex and fight the Computer again.
But Hellon-O, being a former Armed Forces member, wants to take her "army" with her. For that reason, she has organized her tribe into a miniature of Alpha Complex. The caves are the Complex, it is powered by miniature fission reactors (campfires), everyone has a security clearance (check out the facepaint), and the Computer is everywhere (well, she plays the part of the Computer sometimes — executing "clones" for no apparent reason). She's a little cracked.
However, when the Troubleshooters are brought before her, she will be elated:
"A rescue party! At last! I knew the Computer wouldn’t abandon me! Here, sit down; have something to eat!"
Hellon-O orders her PLC clones (hunters, gatherers, and cooks) to bring food. She's given everything an Alpha Complex name:
•	Mineral Water = Bouncy Bubble Beverage (That's not carbonation, that's radiation!)
•	Dry, crusted algae = Algae Chips (Tastes like the inside of a sweat sock — in other words, a decent imitation.)
•	Squirrel Meat = Imitation SoyLyke FoodProduct (Gamy.)
•	Roast Pork = SyntheSpam (Hope they cooked it long enough.)
While the Troubleshooters choke down the food, Hellon-O will tell her version ofwhat happened to her team:
"We left Alpha Complex and wandered in the Outdoors for many daycycles. Treason was rampant in the party, and I had to keep everyone in line. Our Loyalty Officer was the first through his six-pack, unfortunately, but he didn’t seem to be doing his job, anyway.
"Here. Have some more SyntheSpam. Don’t worry about the entrails. They’re chewy.
"Anyway, I soon noticed splits in our party. Regardless of all the attempts I made to unify our group and keep us on the Computer’s mission, they kept growing and growing. Finally, open warfare among the party members broke out. It was right before we were attacked by the giant, radioactive cockroach... "I was able to escape and fled downstream to this miniature Complex. I

united the clones and began to teach them our ways. I only had to execute a few for treason before the rest were whipped into shape.
"Now, with your help, we can lead them back to Alpha Complex.”
At this point, the Troubleshooters have several choices. Their mission is to execute all the former Troubleshooters they find out here in the Outdoors — including Hellon-O- WLS-6. However, she is surrounded by fanatically-loyal warriors and she seems willing to "come quietly" back to Alpha Complex.
And there are a few "side bets" here as well. Anyone belonging to the Death Leopard secret society will recognize Hellon-O as a member (in fact, they were probably told she was one) from the symbols on her warriors. Also, Hellon-O will explain that the only way back to Alpha Complex is along the river, which is patrolled by the CorMets and the Pseidons.
"We found out Tweek-I-BOT was a member of Corpore Metallica — that’s a secret society that worships bots — soon after we left Alpha Complex. He freaked out when he wasn’t surrounded by metal, and tried to steal all the team’s equipment. He killed two of my loyal officers despite my best efforts and made off with the team’s vehicle.
"Pseid-O-NNE was sneakier. He bitched and moaned and complained the whole time we were Outdoors — he said he felt ’cut off from some sort of ’collective unconscious’ — and started to worm his way into everyone else’s minds in the group using his treasonous mutant powers. I was able to resist, of course, but he finished off the rest of the team and I was forced to escape.
"Pseid-O-NNE and Tweek-I-BOT are now the leaders of two groups of Out-door-sector clones, the CorMets and the Pseidons. They are doing everything they can to block my passage back to Alpha Complex."
This leaves the Troubleshooters with two clear choices:
Fxecure Heuox-0
This is according to the Computer's orders and, if the TreasonBot has survived to this point, it will loudly indicate this. Even ifthe Troubleshooters decide against this course of action, the TreasonBot — excuse me, "the M-CAB" — will cause enough of a row that a fight is almost certain to break out.
Ifthe Troubleshooters manage to finish offHellon-O (not an easy task), they will have about fifty tribesmen to deal with, not to mention a cliff to scale and two other tribes to fight through to get home.

Hellon-O then starts to lay out her plans for attacking the CorMets and the Pseidons in order to push through to Alpha Complex. They are very involved and complicated, and, to anyone with any knowledge of tactics, they appear completely unworkable and ludicrous. Most of the Troubleshooters should think they're fine.
Just kidding. Go into a long speech (as Hellon-O) about the plan. Discuss things like "frontal sweep attacks" and "air superiority" while directing your "commanders" (savages who hardly understand what she is saying). Plan to use resources Hellon-O could not possibly have while confiding in the Troubleshooters that, as generals in her glorious army, they will have to lead her troops to victory. 
”... and so, when we finish the tactical bombardment of their gun emplace¬ments here, here, and here,” Hellon-O jabs her finger dramatically at the tabletop map she’s set up in her cave. Strangely, it doesn’t look much like the river you came down—it looks more like an orbital map ofthe world... not that you would know what the world is, of course.. ”... We’ll deploy our mechanized infantry along their west flank,” you look out toward the direction ofHellon-O’s gesture and see two natives struggling to lift a large, brown pole and jam a stone wheel onto its end, "and our air force will dive bomb them from above,” another savage is trying to teach an oversized parrot to carry a rock.
”When do you think your troops will be ready?” one of your number asks.
Hellon-O looks at you quizzically and spreads both her arms wide, ”Why, we’re ready now!”
Things don't look good.

The Troubleshooters are in a pickle. Allied with an insane Death Leopard with delusions of military conquest, they have to make their way back upriver to Alpha Complex — through two hostile tribes who probably know they are coming.
The question is, do the Troubleshooters wait and go with Hellon-O ("All great leaders attack at dawn!" she says) or do they slip off during the nightcycle?
GOWG MTH Шиом-0
This is a perfectly acceptable, ifpretty darn strange, thing for the Troubleshooters to do. First of all, Hellon-O is mad. I mean, she isn't angry or anything — she's completely gone-'round-the-transtube, whoops!-there-she-goes, stark-raving-Lune-I. She should become more and more obviously mad as the evening progresses. Here are some possible symptoms:
•	Paranoia: Normally a healthy reaction in any clone, Hellon-O has been away from Alpha Complex too long. She is used to natives who bow to her will unquestioningly, but now she has started thinking about Alpha Complex again — and she is worried about betrayal. While insisting that all her warriors get some sleep, she is continuously waking them up and putting them on guard duty. Soon, everyone in the camp is on guard duty ... but they are all supposed to be guarding each other. Eventually, Hellon-O will start executing "traitors" who fall asleep, wander off to relieve themselves, or who appear to be looking in the wrong direction.
•	Alarms: On the eve of her triumph, Hellon-O is worried about a sneak attack. Waking everyone from a sound sleep will be the sound of explosions. She is using grenades to kill "intruders on the perimeter" — really helpless little non-irradiated squirrels. This, again, doesn't seem that irregular to the Troubleshooters (they were probably doing it a few daycycles ago), but it is disturbing.
•	Making deals: Hellon-O expects to be promoted when she returns to Alpha Complex and reports her team's treason — and brings a veritable army back with her. She will wake up each ofthe characters in turn, trying to coerce them into backing up every part ofher story when the debriefing comes. She will grow manic about this — any Troubleshooter who cannot reiterate her story almost word-for-word will be regarded as a threat to her authority.
•	The TreasonBot: The M-CAB shows up again. Maybe it was destroyed and fixed, lost and found, or whatever, but it is back. Hellon-O confronts the Team Leader with the M-CAB as the little bas — excuse me, as the bot tells the former Troubleshooter the entire mission ... you know, all that incriminating stuffabout executing the former Troubleshooters. The Team Leader will either have to run for it or convince her the bot is nuts.
Basically, try to make the camp like a miniature Alpha Complex with even fewer known rules. It should seem dangerous to clones who've spent their lives under the watchful eye of the Computer — and that's saying something.
When the time conies, the Troubleshooters can cut out or not ... though you're encouraged to make them hurry off ifyou can. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. ..
GOWG /T ALOW
Ifthe Troubleshooters head offinto the darkness alone, they will have to scale the cliffs ofthe waterfall at night and head upriver. Sometime while they are climbing, they should realize that Hellon-0 has realized they are gone and is signalling the alarm — obviously, they have gone to warn the CorMets and the Pseidons.
She will send her fastest warriors in pursuit. This will lead to a cliff-face battle and possibly a fight at the top of the waterfall.
F/GHT OR FALL
The Troubleshooters should really be getting into the action now. It would be a good time to remind them that any secret society members or possible traitors could cut their witnesses by staging a little "avalanche" or "loose rock." This should increase the paranoia level.
Not to mention those savages — man, can they climb fast! The Troubleshooters arejust reaching the top ofthe cliffwhen the savages get within rock- and spear-throwing range.
The Troubleshooters must make Agility rolls to hang onto the cliff face and they can make dodge checks to get out ofthe way of missiles. If they want to fight, they can fire back or throw things themselves. Anyone who dies here (by plummeting or getting impaled on a spear) will join the action at the top of the cliff face (the Computer is still, somehow, watching).
Make this a dramatic scene. If you can, make it funny as well. For example, birds probably live in the cliff face, and they can attack. Or maybe a GRAM comes out of the water and grabs at Troubleshooters and savages alike.
Eventually, the Troubleshooters reach the top of the cliff face and probably repel the savages. But the army is on its way. They'd better hurry ifthey want to escape.
The Troubleshooters can take the small boats that are still there and try to paddle upstream or across the river ifthey want. This is very dangerous and will probably land
them at the bottom ofthe waterfall again — a Bad Thing. Or, they can run into the woods Д GRAM OR A t(fL~0~GRM
and hope to avoid the natives on foot.	уоу OBCtOC,
 
 
RUHH/HG THROUGH TH£ fOR£ST
It's the middle of the nightcycle, the Troubleshooters are in deep woods, running from savages. Now would be a perfect time for:
•	An Encounter with Natives: Not one of the tribes. Instead, go for a post-apocalyptic hermit, or a "Mad Max" type. It could start out as a fight and turn out being friendly ... or vice versa.
•	A GRAM Attacks: The Thing that Stalks These Here Woods shows up. Maybe the Troubleshooters were hearing stories around the campfire (excuse me: "open-air fission reaction") from the natives, but they dismissed them as superstition. Well, here it comes.
•	The Woods are Evil:... Or at least hard to get around in. Bumping into trees, falling into holes, clotheslining on branches. These are all fun things for technojerks like the Troubleshooters to have to deal with. Imagine giant, radioactive brambles? "How do you get these things off?l"
The flight through the woods can be as short or long as you want. Just so the Troubleshooters end up within sight ofAlpha Complexjust as the giant lamp on the blue dome comes on. Funny, it seems to be right over Alpha Complex — hey, maybe the Computer sent it to guide us! A light over a place we can rest! What a good idea!
That's when all hell breaks loose.
A ftGHT fOR THE fM/SH
The Troubleshooters are attacked on one side by Pseid-0-NNE and his natives, while the CorMets, led by Tweek-I-BOT, set upon them from the other.

TH£ RfTURH Of TH£ MW
One ofthe many things Hellon-O forgot to mention is that she allowed a valuable piece of equipment — the MTV transbot — to fall into the CorMet's hands.
Originally, the MTV was a strange, four-legged transbot used to travel over irregular terrain. It is an all-terrain vehicle, as long as all the terrain it has to go over is perfectly flat. Otherwise, it moves jerkily and haphazardly, falling often.
Or, at least, it did.
Now, free of all the bureaucracy and drugs ofAlpha Complex, Tweek-I has managed a few improvements. The transbot is now much smarter than it was, and it is fairly well armed.
flTV Transbot Armor: A117 Wounds: 10 Move: Slow
Weapons: Laser Cannon III (13L), Firethrower (15E) 
The MTV Transbot will come into the battle after it has started in earnest. At first, it looks like the Pseidons are winning—they've actually started using their spears—but, when the MTV lumbers onto the field, it looks like it will crust, laser, or flame anyone who . gets in its way.
And that includes the Troubleshooters.
To me REAR, Mt/ws!
Should the Troubleshooters think of fleeing, they will notice a group of screaming maniacs, led by Hellon-O-WLS, coming upriver. Theyjoin the fray, leaving the Trouble¬shooters with nowhere to go.
Run the battle as a desperately confused fracas. The MTV is stomping over anyone it can, Pseid-O-NNE is using his telekinesis and telepathy on anyone he can, and Hellon- O is throwing grenades around. Lots of savages are dying, but the Troubleshooters are standing, relatively unharmed, in the middle.
What do they do?
FUUNG me BATTU
This doesn't work. They get attacked from all sides if they try it. Everyone dies eventually and goes to "Aftermath: Debrief or Die, Citizen!" Good idea, though.
COMPUTMG rum MfssfON
If anyone thinks, "Hey, we'd better kill offthese bozos while we have the chance," they can give it a try.
miov-o-wis
She'll be the easiest to get to, as she now thinks the Troubleshooters were valiantly leading a sortie against the two enemy tribes and are on her side. Ifthe Troubleshooters fight their way to her side, they can attack her and gain bonuses for surprise.
Pse/o-O-NNf
A little harder to kill, Pseid-O-NNE doesn't think anyone is on his side, and he's using his telepathy to confuse everyone, while throwing bodies left and right with his TK. He'll be tougher to get to, but a laser through his forehead will do the job.
Tweetc-f-BOT
Up inside the mighty MTV, Tweek-I is very hard to reach. The transbot is nowhere near as shaky as it used to be (see the original "Into the Outdoors with Gun and Camera," if you've got it), though not as versatile either. If a Troubleshooter can get on top of it, he can climb in and finish Tweek-I. If not, the team will have to figure out some way to critically damage the bot or trip it up.
W?NN!NG AND LOS/NG
Depending on the Troubleshooters' success or failure in their mission, the adventure
can end two ways.
УАУ! № И/ОА//
The Troubleshooters kill off the three remaining ex-Troubleshooters. Flybots from Alpha Complex sweep the area with laser fire (the Computer was watching), driving the natives off and maybe killing a few Troubleshooters. Eventually, they land, taking all survivors back to Alpha Complex. Go to the Aftermath.
У AY! We LOST!
Hey, at least it was probably relatively painless. The Troubleshooters are killed by the natives or the ex-Troubleshooters or some other random act of violence and any who have clones left wake up in the Aftermath. 
ДгтетАтн; Deeme OR Oie, Cmzeu!
You are in a dark room. You’d say it was similar to the room you were briefed for this mission in, oh, so long ago, but that would be pretty silly — I mean, that was dark, too, but there were lights. Click. Oh, there they are. Right in your faces.
"Citizens! Your mission is over. It was a complete Fill in the blank. Now you
must be debriefed."
The lights go off, softer lights go on, and you see you are in a small, fairly cozy room, with two Vulture Troopers and Lauren-B-CAL.
"Welcome back to Alpha Complex, citizens," she says in her low, husky voice. Gee, it sure sounded differently on hormone suppressants, didn’t it?
Each Troubleshooter is led off, one at a time, to a separate briefing area by Lauren and a Vulture Trooper. She will debriefthe Troubleshooter with a series of questions designed to make the Troubleshooter incriminate himself. The Computer will chime in occasionally with observations. It will show clips from the team's Multicorder occasionally — or from overhead flybot scans, or whatever.
Rt/WMG THF OiBRfFFWG
This is your last chance to screw over the players before they go home for the night. Ask double-edged questions, don't let them explain answers, and refer to cryptic things they said or did during the adventure. It's okay if you distort facts — contradicting the Computer is treason.
Basically, you want to get them to the point where they are swearing up and down, "It's not my fault! I didn't do it! I was mind controlled! It was ... those others! Yeah, that's the ticket! Citizen Scape-I-GOT made me do it!"
Let them betray each other. Make them do it. It doesn't matter anyway.
SlAPS MO Bit/WS
Total up your treason points, subtracting five for each of the former traitors dutifully executed by the Troubleshooter team. Then ignore it. Focus on roleplaying.
Anyone who really got into their character should be rewarded, regardless of who incriminated whom or who did what when. Don't tell the players this, but that's all we care about.
Dress it up a little. Some examples below give you a good idea of the "rewards" and "punishments" the Computer might award:
•	Promotion and Reassignment: "The Computer is so pleased with your actions on this mission that It has wisely decided to promote you to Orange clearance! Congratulations! You are also to be reassigned to a new Troubleshooter team headed on an ultra-secret mission. I can't tell you what it is, exactly, but it involves travel beyond the Outdoors in a new, R&D-approved transbot. I think the transbot is called the AC Challenger. It will be launching in five minutecycles." Slap: The clone will be killed on the mission when the rubber-band launching cable snaps.
•	Demotion, Reassignment: "The Computer is most displeased with your conduct on this mission, Citizen. You are demoted to Infrared clearance and reassigned to help re¬lay out the track on PSU transtube which we are certain you were responsible for fouling up. When you are finished, you may return to the Troubleshooters. Oh, and look out for the transbots — we're going to keep them running. Schedules, you know." Slap: Clone is maimed by transbot accident, then blamedfor getting in the way of the car. What are you, stupid — standing on those tracks while the transtube is active is asking for trouble!
•	Fine: "Due to your negligence, Computer property was destroyed, the mission was not a complete success, and many high clearance clones were really put out. You are hereby fined 10,000,000 plasticreds which you will work off between missions scrubbing the inside of Food Vats in YUK sector." Slap: The clone gets all the Food Vat spillage he can
eat.
•	Promotion, Reward: "Citizen, you distinguished yourself on this mission. As a reward, you are hereby promoted to Orange clearance and given 100 plasticreds as an
additional mission bonus!" Slap: The clone gets mugged and beat up by those Yellow clones from the PSU transtube five minutecycles after he leaves the debriefing. 
• Reward, Continued Service: "Congratulations, Citizen! You have completed your first mission for the Computer! As a reward, you are given this authentic Teela O'Malley collectable pin and matching wrist-bracelet, and allowed to continue with the Trouble¬shooters!" Slap: The clone must continue with the Troubleshooters.
Oh, gee, we forgot to give out bennies. Well, you can make some up if you want to ...
Stay Alert!

Uswe Рневемемтео CHARACTCRS
Pregenerated characters are easier to use because they can be handed out to veteran or new players alike. The pregenerated characters we have listed here are designed for this adventure, but can be used in any Paranoia adventure you play.
7HE CHARACTER SHEET
Each character sheet is one page in size — a half-page front and a half-page back. Y ou have our permission to photocopy them and separate them for your use.
THE АНАТОМУ of THE CHARACTER SHEET
The front ofthe character sheet contains all the character's most common information — his name, security clearance, skills, etc. This stuff isn't a secret.
Player Name, Character Name, Security Clearance, Clone Number, Service Group: These are the basics of the character. You can change the names, but each character begins at clone number 1 and security clearance Red (that's why they're circled). As the character progresses in rank and loses clones, circle the new appropriate value. The service group has been generated for each character as well. Note: IntSec agents will only have their cover society listed on the front.
Attributes, Known Skills, Derived Attributes: The character's attributes are listed here, followed by the parenthetical skill bases. Underneath each attribute, you'll find skills the character knows, along with their values, listed. Any benefits the character gained from Service Group training are included. Across from the character's attributes, you'll find his derived attributes as well.
Personal Equipment, Plasticreds: This area is blank, since none ofthe characters start out with any basic equipment. It can be filled in as you go. There is room on the sheet for damage values, ranges, and other notes. A running total of plasticreds can also be kept.
Character Illustration: Each character has his or her own picture. Aren't they neat?
Damage Status, Total Armor: These are two "combat boxes." The character's current damage status, along with modifiers, can be listed here (it's blank now, because the character is unwounded), as well as the character's armor value (his Macho stat plus any armor he's wearing). Note: The character could end up with several different Total Armor values, since most armor protects against only certain attacks.
The back ofthe character sheet is for secret, or possibly treasonous, stuff.
Character Name, Power Attribute, Secret Society, Mutant Power(s): The
latter two are really secret — it could be worth the character's life if anyone found out about them (unless, of course, the character is a registered mutant). The character's Power attribute is also sort of a secret, since having a Power attribute would be like admitting you could use a mutant power if you had one.
Background, etc.: A lot of details about the character that the player can use to roleplay with. Not all characters have the same details.
Current Secret Society Mission: The pregenerated Troubleshooters listed here have secret society missions you can work into the adventure. Ifyou have the players create their own characters, you can use these missions as examples ofnasty things you can force your players ... err, the Troubleshooters, to do.

Secret Society: Romantics
Mutant Power(s): Levitation	BACK
Power Attribute: 9
Background: You were enlisted right out of the clone vats to be trained as an Internal Security agent for the Computer. Transferred to PLC, you learned a little about their boring, bureaucratic ways before you were able to turn your superior in for filling requests for equipment too promptly — imagine, sectors were get¬ting requests filled on a monthcydey basis! He was really making the other PLC supervisors look bad.
The Computer recognized your initiative and cre¬ativity, and asked ifyou would like to volunteer for the Troubleshooters. Being a motivated and sneaky indi¬vidual, you thought this was the place to be. Now, you have the freedom to move about Alpha Complex on missions and spy on your "teammates" as well.
F avorite F ood: Keyhole Krunch Cereal ("Look through every keyhole for a toy surprise!")
Favorite Saying: "I spy with my little surveillance camera, hidden microphone, and one-way mirror ... a
traitor!"
Treasonous Possessions: Yourjammies (which you start the adventure "Back to the Outdoors" in) are actually flexible kevlar (P3).
Current Secret Society Mission: The Romantics would like you to make contact with as many Outdoors clones as possible, and interview them (on tape, if possible) about their histories, lifestyle, and culture.
The Outdoors may be the key to a return to the Old Reckoning pe¬riod (clones cannot have lived in Alpha Complex forever — there would be stuff piled up all over!)
Knowledge of T eammates:
Lad-R-UPP is dan-gerous —he's almost as ambitious as you are. Cathy-R-SIS is a stupid dupe you can manipulate in your evil schemes.

Secret Society: Trekkers Mutant Power(s): Regeneration Power Attribute: 7
Background: A nameless drone monitoring an out- of-the-way Computer node backup frequency, you achieved notoriety when NY C sector experienced a "brown out." All the power went down all over the sector, except in your node. Using your superior skills and intellect, you were able to keep security cameras all over the sector running, filming all the treasonous looting and rioting going on—to the extreme discom¬fort of those involved, not to mention Power Services, who claimed they were unable to get any power for the sector at all.
Promoted to Red clearance, you found your old position a little ... exposed. After a few unsuccessful attempts on your life by Power Services clones (oh, sure, they said they were just rewiring your conduit, but you saw what they attached to your chair), you decided you'd better volunteer for a more mobile duty. With your record, you should go far in the Trouble¬shooters (the farther, the better).
Least Favorite Service Group: Power Services. You get nervous around a light socket.
Favorite Saying: "So, you say you're here to fix the shower, eh? Well, we'll just see about that!" Treasonous Knowledge: Rob-R-COP-1 is a member of the Romantics secret society, which is friendly to your secret society.
Current Secret Society Mission: Seek out and ex- U plore the Outdoors! Bringback \(\^ information on OUT sector, as well as a map to the famed OUT sector airlock (it is under tight security). Teach any clones you see about pacifism and nonviolence (and if they don't like it, shoot them).

Background: Those damn machines. You've been slaving away in Alpha Complex since the day you were breached, keeping 'em running. And whatthanks do you get? They malfunction at the worst possible times, spit oil into your face, and, just last week, a vendorbot almost fell on top ofyou. Just because you were trying to tip a free BBB out of it.
But you've got the idea now. The Frankenstein Destroyers have put you on to the true way ofadvance- ment. The Computer is just another machine, and you've got to learn how to play It. You were able to wangle a promotion when you stopped a "berserk" scrubot from damaging a valuable docbot. Heh, heh. You were the one who reprogrammed it to go berserk. And you took care of the docbot later.
Getting out of Power Services was a good idea, though — too many chances for the machines to take their revenge.
Favorite Tool: The super-spanner. With a monkey wrench that size, you could "reprogram" a thousand computer chips at once.
Favorite Saying:	Machine! Gimme my

Treasonous Knowledge: Lad-R- UPP made a bunch of Power Ser¬vices clones in NYC sector look bad and a bunch of machines look good.

Current Secret Society Mis¬sion: Bashing machines is al¬ways a good idea, but you'd re¬ally like to make sure everyone else hates machines as well.
Secretly sabotage all the equip¬ment you can, and blame any¬thing that goes wrong on equip-	r

Background: You're an entertainer, not a Trouble¬shooter! But when your registered mutation started acting up on the air, your popularity as a clone advice columnist plummeted. Nobody wanted to hear advice from a registered mutie!
At least your prestige at HPD&MC was enough to get you a Red clearance promotion. The Agency" decided to transfer you to the Troubleshooters in the hopes that it would elevate your career again. Ifyou do well enough, maybe you can get your own talk show — "Missman-R-ISZ: Killin' Commies and Solvin' Prob-lems!"
Sigh.
Secret Contact: The Agency" is a small subdivision of HPD&MC that handles its online talent. They put you out here in the line offire, but they want to protect their investment. Ifyou can contact them, they might arrange for help to arrive in the nick oftime (and still make you look good).
Favorite Saying: "Now, now, deary, it isn't that bad. What was your problem, anyway?"
Secret Fear: Y our agent warned you (j against "looking bad" on camera.
You'll try to glom credit and good camera angles anytime a multicorder is pointed in your di¬rection.	t ^
Current Secret Society Mis- I sion: Make yourself popu lar again! You're having a hard time, honey, and if you don't want to stay out in the cold with a bunch ofpsychotic Troubleshoot¬ers, you'd better get some good exposure!
Knowledge of Team mates: Big, hulking clones look great on camera, and Dainge-R-OUS is the biggest, hulkingest clone you've ever seen. Ifyou can get him to be your leading male in a bunch of action shots, you'll be a shoo-in for re¬assignment. 
RED CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY RED-CLEARANCE CITIZENS 
A Cum TOR THE COMPUTER'S EUTE
Welcome, Citizen Troubleshooters, to the end ofParanoia: The Fifth Edition! Whoa! This is a really big book—but it's not over yet. See, we had such fun working on this book, we just couldn't stop — at least not without giving you a little more helpful information on being one ofthe Computer's bestest buddies ... a Troubleshooter!
Back in the Players' Section, we gave you all kinds of neat information about being a Troubleshooter. The gamemaster, if he's around somewhere, probably gave you a little more. Or not. It's up to him, you see. But take a look at the top of this page — see where it says "Red Clearance?" That means you can read this information and learn more about the Computer's elite.
The focus ofThe IncompleatI Compleat Troubleshooter is on a little thing we like to call Mandatory Bonus Duty. We mentioned it back in the Players' Section—you can even see some ofthe Neat-O logos alongside the MBD descriptions — but we didn't go into great detail. This appendix will help you out.
And here you thought it might be vestigial.
MAHOHTORY Bouus DUTY
So, you may ask, what else are you going to tell me about Mandatory Bonus Duty? Go ahead, ask.
MBD was created by Troubleshooter HQ and approved by the Computer to be a way for Troubleshooter teams to be internally organized and efficient. Each MBD office covers one very, very important aspect of Troubleshooter duty. Each officer is in charge of one or more MBDs (depending on the number ofTroubleshooters on the team). The individual MBDs are all described on pages 41 and 42 of the Players'Section.
ОетештА/G YOUR MBD
The Computer has a foolproof system for determining which clones are suitable for what Mandatory Bonus Duty. It instructs its Briefing Officers to administer the "Man¬datory Bonus Duty Determination Test 88-9b" at the beginning of every mission. The results are then subjected to intense scrutiny by HPD&MC, and the MBDs are assigned.

AOMWSTER/HO THE MBDDT 88~9B
Gamemasters, this is a really fun part ofthe adventure. No, really — trust us. Y ou'll enjoy it. The MBDDT 88-9b is a good way to start off any adventure. It gets everyone into a Paranoia mood and allows you to mess with the Troubleshooters' (and the players') minds right from the start. 
PHOTOCOPY THE MBDDT 88-9e
The next two pages in this book are the actual test. You have our permission to photocopy them as many times as you need for personal use.
OtsTR/ei/TE THE TESTS
Pass out the tests — or, better yet, have someone else pass them out. Pick a sucker at random, and have them sign a piece ofpaper saying that they passed out a certain number ofthe tests. While everyone's taking the test, you can play with the piece ofpaper.
Gamemaster: Thank you, Suck-R, for passing out the tests. Please collect them now.
Suck-R: Always happy to help, Briefing Officer, sir. Here they are. (Returns to seat.)
Gamemaster: Just a minute, Suck-R, there seems to be a problem. On this sheet you signed, stating that you passed out the tests, it says there were 60 forms distributed. Yet you have only returned 6. What happened to the other 54?
Suck-R: (Looks at paper, sees hastily scratched in "0" after the "6". Gulps) I don't know, friend Briefing Officer. (Spins in place, pointing at rest of team) It must have been them! They mind- controlled me and made me dispose of the papers!
ADM/N/STER THE TESTS
"Citizens, please answer every question in the spaces provided. Check only one multiple-choice answer per question, and only use the space provided for the essay questions. The Computer values promptness, so take this test quickly and quietly. Do not write in the boxes marked 'Office Use Only' unless you want your fingers cut off. No cheating."
That's pretty much it. If players have questions, the Briefing Officer will tell them to shut up and take the test. If anyone looks like they are thinking, the Briefing Officer will hassle them about taking too much time, being out of uniform, or anything else you can think of.
COLLECT AND GRADE THE TESTS
Have some fun collecting the tests. After you have all of them, you can play a little game:
Briefing Officer: Excellent work, Troubleshooters! Now, as soon as Pats-Y finishes her test, we can get started.
Pats-Y: Huh?
Briefing Officer: Your MBDDT 88-9b. The test you're supposed to be working on.
Pats-Y: (Looks around nervously) But I turned mine in with the rest of the team ... honest!
Ifyou want to start assigning treason points, or even executing clones, go right ahead. You can force Pats-Y or even the whole team to re-take the test, with the Briefing Officer hanging over their shoulders, go ahead.
ASS/GN/NG TREASON POLNTS AND ixEcurtNe TRA/TORS
As a general rule, anyone with a perfect score is a traitor and should either be executed or assigned, oh, ten treason points right offthe bat. Otherwise, subtract whatever score the Troubleshooter got from 30 on each section. Ifthe total difference (for all six sections) is lower than 10, assigned five treason points to the clone for possible cheating. Ifthe total difference is higher than 30, assign five treason points for stupidity.
Feel free to execute traitors for treasonous answers or suspicious scores. Also, note that several answers on the test have shaded backgrounds. Anyone who even answers one of these questions receives five treason points per answer. These answers where thrown in to root out traitors and check for treasonous knowledge.
Writing in the wrong places or skipping questions should be punished accordingly: two treason points per instance.
ASS(GMWG тне MB Os
There are several methods you can use to assign the MBDs. The first is to check and see who had the lowest score in each category. Obviously, that person needs work on those types of skills and should be assigned the MBD there. This is most important for the Team Leader—whoever gets the absolute lowest score of all (total) should be given thatjob, so the Computer can keep an eye on him. 
ULTRAVIOLET CLEARANCE ... APPROVED FOR USE BY HIGH PROGRAMMERS ONLY. ..
Ifyou have ties, or this is much more work than you wanted to go through, then assign the ranks in the following order ofParanoia exper- tise/knowledge, based on the tests andyour own knowledge of the players:
•	Happiness Officer
•	Equipment Guy
•	Communications and Recording Officer
•	Hygiene Officer
•	Loyalty Officer
•	Team Leader
So, the Happiness Officer should be the per¬son who did the be st on the te st and has the most apparent Paranoia knowledge, while the Team Leader and the Loyalty Officer should have as little knowledge ofwhat's going on as anybody.
THE ALTERA/АТЕ MBO OETERMWAT/OU
PROCEDURE
Study the results of the tests very, very carefully. Ask piercing questions of each Trouble¬shooter, probing their innermost desires and thoughts. Then:
•	Have everyone roll a d20. High roller gets his choice ofMBD. In the case of a tie, give the two Troubleshooters two treason points each for being uncooperative and give the choice to the next-highest roll.
•	Choose them yourself, at random.
•	Accept bribes, then choose them. If anyone brought munchies to the game session, they're on the right track.
•	Send somebody to the store for munchies, talk about them until they get back, and then give them the choice ofMBD.
•	Send your players out on a quest ("Find the tongues ofthree rabid emu and return on your knees.")*
• Distribute bats and have them settle the matter like real Troubleshooters.**
*This will delay the beginning ofthe adventure,
**This will seriously delay the beginning ofthe adventure and West End Games takes no responsibility for injuries obtained.
MORE, OR USS, TMW Stx TROUBLESHOOTERS „ A/o PROBLEM!
If you have fewer than six Troubleshooters, assign the MBDs that you think are important, or fun, for the mission. Loyalty Officers and Happiness Officers are great, and Team Leaders are good for any team that has at least one inexperienced member. Of course, you can assign more than one MBD to any Troubleshooter.
Ifyou have more than six Troubleshooters, assign the MBDs you have and either make other Troubleshooters "assistants" or create your own MBDs. "Keeping Track of the Funbot Officer" or "Holding Onto the Medkit Officer" work well, and the classic "Dr. Smith Officer" ("Oh, the pain" — he's in charge of complaining) can be a riot.
