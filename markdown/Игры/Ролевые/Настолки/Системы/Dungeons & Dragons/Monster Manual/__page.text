!! Monster Manual

The Monster Manual (Monstrous Manual, or Monstrous Compendium) is the primary sourcebook for monsters in the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. It includes monsters derived from mythology, and folklore, as well as creatures created for D&D specifically. It describes each with game-specific statistics (such as number of hit dice), and a brief description of its habits and habitats. Most of the entries also have an image of the creature. Along with the Player's Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide, it is one of the three "core rulebooks" in all editions of the Dungeons & Dragons game.

!!! Current Monster Manual (3rd and 3.5 Edition Dungeons & Dragons)

The current version of the Monster Manual (July 2003), subtitled Core Rulebook III v3.5, is a revision of the Monster Manual (2000) for Third Edition Dungeons & Dragons.

The v3.5 revision has a slightly different entry on each monster, particularly the division of the attack into Attack and Full Attack entries. Also, most of the monsters now have an enhanced version of them near the original one as an example of advancement (usually either with a template or with class levels). Many monsters now have instructions on how to use them as player characters.

These volumes are not major variations from the earlier concepts of the Monster Manual; they update older monsters to Third Edition rules. In 2001, Monster Manual won the Origins Award for Best Graphic Design of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure, or Supplement 2000.

Monster Manual II (2002) and Fiend Folio (2003) are new monster-specific rulebooks, and contain mostly updated monsters from the sourcebooks of earlier editions, though some others of the specific monsters featured therein have almost no overlap with those of their first edition namesakes. There have been no new versions of Monster Manual II and Fiend Folio for 3.5 edition, however update errata for both volumes and for the original third edition Monster Manual are available for download from the publishers website [1].

Monster Manual III (2004) contains more monsters and was originally published in the v3.5 format. This Monster Manual is notable for having descriptions within on where the monsters might be found in the Eberron and Forgotten Realms campaign settings.

Monster Manual IV (July 2006) is also published in the v3.5 format, and uses the new stat block format that was introduced in the Dungeon Master's Guide II. Monster Manual IV contains fewer actual monsters than Monster Manual II and III, but has sample lairs and encounters for them, gives stats for classes and templates applied to old creatures (for example Drow Ninja) and full page maps. Also, like the third, it has information on where the monsters might appear in Eberron or the Forgotten Realms. The book also ties into the "Year of the Dragons" theme that Wizards of the Coast has planned out for 2006 with the Spawn of Tiamat, yet contains no new monsters that are considered 'true dragons.'

In October 2006 the Special Edition Monster Manual was released, completing the set of special edition core rulebooks started in 2004 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons. Like the others, this book was leather-bound with silver-gilt edges and a cloth bookmark. The book was expanded with some new information, 31 new illustrations, and a new index. All collected errata up to its release date was included in this revision, making this edition the most up-to-date Monster Manual so far[2].

Monster Manual V was released in July 2007, published in the same format as the Monster Manual IV, featuring lairs and tactics and like III and IV how these new monsters fit into Eberron and Forgotten Realms. According to previews of the Night Below Dungeons & Dragons miniatures set, some of the new monsters that will feature in it include the Greenspawn Zealot, the Arcadian Avenger, the Verdant Reaver, and the Carnage Demon.

!!!  Earlier Monster Manuals

!!!! Early Dungeons & Dragons

The earliest Dungeons and Dragons box games did not have separate Monster Manuals but provided listings for monsters in the manuals in the boxed set. The original boxed set included a Book 2: Monsters and Treasure.

After the separation D&D into separate "Basic" and "Advanced" games, the "Basic" game continued to be published in level-based boxes. Monsters of the appropriate level were included in the rulebooks for the various "Basic Game" sets (Basic, Expert, Companion, Master, and Immortal) and later collected in a single D&D Rules Cyclopedia book.

The original book actually bearing the title Monster Manual was written by Gary Gygax and published in 1977. It was the first hardcover book for any Dungeons & Dragons game, and the first of the Core Manuals published for the new Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) version of the game. Except for a cover art change in 1983 to match a new logo and house style, and some minor corrections introduced in the 1978 printings, it went through very little change in its fifteen printings up to 1989.

The credited artists of the first manual, in order, are David C. Sutherland III (DCS), David A. Trampier (DAT), Tom Wham (TW), and Jean Wells.

The first edition Monster Manual is also famous for the topless portrayals of its female monsters, such as the succubus and Type V demons, the lamia, the sylph, among others. The casual depiction of female nudity is a hallmark of first edition Dungeons and Dragons art.

Fiend Folio (1981) was published by TSR UK. Much of the Fiend Folio's contents were taken from the Fiend Factory feature of White Dwarf, others were taken from various D&D modules, and some were original creations for this volume. It introduced several popular monsters to the D&D game including drow, githyanki, githzerai, slaad, and death knights. It also featured monsters that were widely ridiculed, such as the flumph, one of the few non-evil creatures presented in that volume. Fiend Folio featured more consistent artwork than the original Monster Manual. The illustrations in this volume were of same general style as the Monster Manual, but were typically darker and made more use of light and shadow.

Monster Manual II (1983) was also credited to Gygax, though some of its contents was taken from various D&D modules.

!!!!  2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons

Monstrous Compendium (1989) replaced the Monster Manual when Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Second Edition was released. The Compendium was a binder of looseleaf sheets rather than a hardback book. The first two volumes contained the "core" monsters of the game. These were followed by a large number of appendix volumes that contained extra monsters for particular campaign settings.

The format was intended to help Dungeon Masters keep all of their monster statistics in one place and in alphabetical order. It would also mean they would only need to purchase core volumes and appendix volumes for the campaigns they wanted, rather than getting a mix of monsters in books. However, the binder format ultimately proved impractical for two main reasons:

* The looseleaf pages had a tendency to tear along the holes for the binder; it was simply not as durable as the hardcover book format for a frequently used reference manual;
* Although the initial releases in the series featured only one monster per page (often with the back side blank) to facilitate alphabetizing, eventually TSR discontinued this practice and included monsters on both sides, making it impossible for DMs to keep monsters in strict alphabetical order.

In 1993 the Monstrous Manual was released, compiling all monsters from the first two volumes of the Monstrous Compendium plus a large number of monsters from other sources into a large 384 page hardcover book. More Monstrous Compendium Appendices were released as a supplement to the Monstrous Manual in the form of paperback books, mostly 128 pages. They included updated reprints of loose leaf Monstrous Compendium Appendices and new volumes.
