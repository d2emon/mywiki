<h1>Dungeons & Dragons Essentials</h1>
This product line debuted in September 2010 and consisted of ten products intended to lower the barrier of entry into the game. Essentials uses the D&D 4th edition rule set and provides simple player character options intended for first-time players.[21] Many of the new player character options emulated features from previous editions, such as schools of magic for the wizard class, as to appeal to older players who had not adopted 4th edition.[22]<br/>
<br/>
The Essentials line contained revisions to the ruleset compiled over the prior two years, in the form of the Rules Compendium, which condensed rules and errata into one volume, while also updating the rules with newly introduced changes.[23][24] The player books Heroes of the Fallen Lands and Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms contained rules for creating characters, as well as new builds for each class described in the books.[25] Other Essentials releases included a Dungeon Master's Kit and Monster Vault, each also containing accessories.
