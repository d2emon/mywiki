<h1>Creature Crucible</h1>
<br/>
Top Ballista is a Creature Crucible supplement and campaign setting that describes Serraine, city of the magical biplane-flying skygnomes.[1] The supplement includes rules for player characters (PCs) for races such as skygnomes, gremlins, pegataurs, and harpies, as well as new air-combat rules.[1]<br/>
<br/>
The aerial city of Serraine flies over the Known World carrying its skygnome inhabitants, creators of bizarre yet workable inventions. The book describes the flying aces of the Top Ballista squadrons, gnomes who pilot flying machines, World War I style fighter planes, equipped with lightning guns and synchronized crossbows.[2] Creatures featured in the product, all living in Serraine, are faenare (birdmen able to create spell-like effects through songs), gnomes, gremlins, harpies, nagpa (vulture-headed humanoids), pegataurs (winged centaurs), sphinxes, and tabi (catlike creatures).[2] Each of these races is introduced by a character who describes their cultures, evolution, and lifestyles. Some creatures start with negative experience points totals when used as PCs.[2]<br/>
<br/>
There are three adventures for characters of various experience point levels. The first contains a basilisk that must be defeated by the PCs. The longest adventure is for characters of levels 7â€“11, and is set within the flying city. The opening stages require a fair bit of detective work from the PCs, and after the investigation in the city, the PCs chase the villain through the air in one of the planes.<br/>
