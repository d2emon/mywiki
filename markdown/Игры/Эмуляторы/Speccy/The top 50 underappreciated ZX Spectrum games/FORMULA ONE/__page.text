Formula One management titles generally miss the balance between detail and accessibility, in the way that the best Football Manager releases have managed. CRL's 1985 game Formula One got surprisingly close. It showed the races from a fixed position, so basically you got to see the cars as they whizzed past the lap marker. But it still found space to fuse in enough strategic elements to make it feel as though you could make a difference. It got easy by the time you'd built your team up, but the journey there was excellent.
