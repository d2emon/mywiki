!! FAT WORM BLOWS A SPARKY

%thumb%Attach:36-fatworm.jpg%%

No home computer in history has attracted game names of the ilk that the ZX Spectrum attracted. Can you imagine any modern publisher now putting out a title called Fat Worm Blows A Sparky? Thankfully, there was an excellent game behind the bizarre title, as you played - and I don't make this up - a worm. More to the point, a worm that's been chased around the circuit board of the Spectrum itself. Beyond daft, but actually quite progressive in the way it used vectors, author Julian Todd has since blogged about his thoughts on the game. It's well worth a read.

As he points out, Fat Worm has its problems, but its quirks, ambition and fun factor remain unblemished by time.
