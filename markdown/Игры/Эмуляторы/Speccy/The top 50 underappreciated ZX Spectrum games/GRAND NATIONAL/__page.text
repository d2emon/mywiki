!! GRAND NATIONAL

The low development cost of Spectrum games meant niches could be easily explored. Horse racing has never been served particularly well by computer games (D&H's strategy title The National was worth a try, even if you missed three birthdays by the time it had done all its calculations). Grand National, though, showed that there was something in the idea of letting you ride a horse in the infamous race of the game's name. It certainly wasn't easy (that's an understatement), and it never captured any sense of pace. But still, it was a lot more fun than it's generally been given credit for.
