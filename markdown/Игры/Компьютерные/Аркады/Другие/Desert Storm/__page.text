  Well Just another game with the Gulf War as topic. Well I don't know, But
  Isn't the Gulf War over for 4 or 5 years? I think so. When I started the 
  game. You could choose between: With blood or without blood. So I choose 
  with blood. Well I dind't see any blood at all in the whole game.

╘═╧═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╧═╛
  Well The installation is kinda simple, just unzip the files and type: install
  (phew that was a hard thing to do) Then the programm asks on which drive 
  you wish to install the game. Then in which directory. Well I noticed some-
  thing funny... When you press enter to install it in the directory MVP. The
  programm says: That directory already exists. In the meanwhile that directory
  didn't exist at all. Okay then the programm unpacks the game itself, and you
  can just start playing.

  Well my first impression was: Wow another Gulf War game. And that is what it
  was. Just another Gulf War game. Nothing more, Nothing less
 
        The Sound : The sound isn't that special. The game only supports:
                    Adlib
                    Sound Blaster
                    Sound Blaster Pro
                    
                    With a soundblaster 16 asp The game crashes and you can't
                    play it.                   

        Graphics  : Well the graphics aren't that special at all. Just normal
                    VGA.
                    
        Speed     : Well the speed is okay, If you haven't a CPU that is slower
                    than a 386 25. Otherwise ( yes you guessed it right ) the
                    game crashes again. 
                    
      Playability : Well the game is only playable with mouse. And that is 
                    not very handy in this game. At least at some parts. By
                    the part where you have to shoot people or shooting scuds
                    out of the air. The mouse is very handy. But when driving
                    a tank or steering a tomahawk rocket I preferred the arrows.

╘═╧═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╧═╛
  Well I think everybody knows the background story of this game. But for those
  who forgot here it comes again.

  Irak invaded Kuwait, and some alliances try to free Kuwait and kill Saddam 
  Hussein. (well you ofcourse play for the allies) and must try to free 
  Kuwait from Irak.

╘═╧═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╧═╛
  Well the object of the game is to complete every different level as good
  as possible, and try to free Kuwait from Irak.

  Okay everything in the Main Menu speaks for itself. But I'll explain what
  to do by the different game types

 *Combat:
  Well this is just a type of Operation Wolf game... Just shoot the men that
  appear in the windows or in the bushes. Too bad that the window doesn't move
  and you just see one picture.. Too Bad. Just use the left mouse button to
  shoot with your gun.

 *Tanks:
  Well in front of you you see a truck which is shooting at you. You can move
  your little tank to the left and the right by using the mouse. (yes no keys)
  Use the left mouse button to fire a normal missile. And use the right mouse
  button to fire a bomb (or something like that)

 *Scuds:
  Well you are in control of a Patriot installation, and you must protect the
  city for the incoming Scuds. Just use your left mouse button to shoot a 
  missile and try to shoot all the scuds before hitting the city.
 
 *Tomahawks:
  Well looks like the Scud game. But only now you are in control of the 
  tomahawk rocket. You get a mission to destroy some buildings. So only destroy
  these buildings and no other. You can move your Tomahawk Rocket by using the
  mouse and move it up or down. By pressing a mouse button you can drop the
  Tomahawk on a target.

  In the Scud part: just point your pointer right in the window and keep it 
  pressed. Now almost every scud will be destroyed.
