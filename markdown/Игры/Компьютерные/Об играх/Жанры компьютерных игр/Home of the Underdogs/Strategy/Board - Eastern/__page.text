!! Board - Eastern
		
Computer versions of board/parlor games that are popular in the East, such as Chinese Chess, Tangram, or Shogi. These games require the player to play against an opponent, either the computer or another human player. They can be either traditional games, or original titles that were invented in the East (except Chess, which is much more popular in the West these days). This category includes only abstract board games - for PC games based on tabletop or "designers" board games (such as Settlers of Catan or Advanced Civilization), check out the Tabletop strategy subgenre instead.
