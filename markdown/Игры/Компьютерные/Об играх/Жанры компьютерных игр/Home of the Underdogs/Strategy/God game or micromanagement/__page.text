!! God game or micromanagement  
		
A popular subgenre originated by Bullfrog's Populous, god games cast the player as a god or supreme being. This subgenre is extended to include micromanagement games, e.g. games that require the player to assign each unit a specific job or task. The best way to determine whether a game belongs in this subgenre here is to see whether it features tiny little icons/people/creatures that run around the screen, doing your bidding ;)
