!!!! Special Cheat Details

The porkcharsui cheat is not really a cheat code but more of a debug mode.  The following keys can be used to do a variety of things.
 
||
||Key	||Effect	||
||K	||Zoom Out[[<<]]There are two sets of 'zoom in' and 'zoom out' keys on the list.  The K and L keys will zoom above the buildings however the buildings are shorter in this zoom, whereas the ] and [ keys zoom and stretch the buildings making them taller, although if you zoom too far out with the ] and [ keys your screen will begin to clip on the sides sometimes.  A trick I found is that if you zoom out first with the K and L keys and then with the ] and [ keys you can keep the buildings short and still zoom out even further.  But be careful because if you go out too far your machine will crash.  It might be possible to zoom out even further with more memory but the machine these were originally tested on only had 32 MB or RAM with a 4 MB video card.  I'm guessing that these are used for different camera shots in the game, sometimes you might want tall buildings and sometimes you might want short buildings.	||
||L	||Zoom In	||
||]		||Zoom Out	||
||[		||Zoom In	||
||NUMPAD 8	||Pan Up		||
||NUMPAD 2	||Pan Down	||
||NUMPAD 6	||Pan Right	||
||NUMPAD 4	||Pan Left		||
||HOME	       	||Center The View	||
||NUMPAD +	||Advance Frame By Frame ||
||ALT	||Quick Frame Advance	||
||R		||Refresh The Screen		||
||D		||Take Screenshot[[<<]]Dumps the contents of your video buffer into a targa file.  e.g. It takes a screenshot in tga format, but it only works in the DOS version.  Each one you take is incremented so if you take 3 shots you will find the files dump0.tga, dump1.tga, and dump2.tga in your gtados sub-directory.  This did not work in the 3Dfx mode but in the Hi Res Mode it worked fine.||
||NUMPAD *	||NAll Weapons With 99 Ammo[[<<]]Additionally if you hit the * key again it will give you 99 ammo again, so you essentially have infinite ammo.||
||C	||Current Status[[<<]]If you are walking it will give you a message like:[[<<]]PED ID AT (X, Y, Z)[[<<]If you are driving it will give you a message like:[[<<]]SPEED 0[[<<]]DAMAGE 0[[<<]]CAR ID 0[[<<]AT (X, Y, Z)[[<<]]where X, Y and Z are your current coordinates.||
