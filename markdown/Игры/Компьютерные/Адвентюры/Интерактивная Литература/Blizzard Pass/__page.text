!! Blizzard Pass
''by Alan Cox - Adventure Soft''

Here will be given a complete solution for this amazingly hard game. This game is strictly deterministic, without random events, so it is possible to give exact step by step solution.

!!! Solution:

E, DIG (to find a garlic), TAKE GARLIC, S, GO CLIFF, EXAMINE WINDOW (it is full of cracks), TAKE SNOW, PUT IT IN CRACKS (the window will fall away), GO WINDOW, N, TAKE ROCK, EXAMINE IT (it is phosphorescent), S, S, W, N, TAKE ROBE, WEAR IT (a protection against freezing), EXAMINE IT (it contains pockets), EXAMINE POCKET, TAKE KEY, S, E, N, GO WINDOW, TAKE SNOW, WET ROBE WITH IT (this will be useful a bit later), GO WINDOW, S, W, EXAMINE STATUE (it is mounted on runners), MOVE IT (it won't shift), WET RUNNERS (with a wet robe), MOVE STATUE (a hole will reveal), D, S, EXAMINE PRIEST, TAKE BLAST, N, U, E, N, GO WINDOW, TAKE SNOW, WET ROBE WITH IT, GO WINDOW, S, E, S, S (you can pass the dark figure only if you wear the robe), TAKE STONE AND CHAIR, TAKE SCROLL, READ IT (some hints, not so easy to understand), N, N, E, GO WELL, EXAMINE PLANK (essential - it will reveal a secret passage), TAKE IT, U, S, TAKE SHIELD (very tricky), S, D (the shield protects you against the heat), E, TAKE SWORD (it is too hot), COOL IT WITH ROBE, TAKE IT, W, U, N, E, READ RUNE (a hint about drawing a pentagram), W, N, W, OPEN COFFIN (a ghoul will climb out), KILL GHOUL (with the sword), EXAMINE COFFIN, TAKE STONE, W, W, W, W, N, TAKE SOAP AND POLISH, POLISH SHIELD (it will become shiny; this will be useful later to reflect the light), S, E, D, E, PUSH PILLAR (to pass accross a fissure, but this also will wake up a snake), GO PILLAR, PUSH IT (this will destroy the snake, but this will also block the way you came from), TAKE STONE, S (the wizard will tell to you that something useful is buried in the cave), N, E (this is a cave, but there is nothing obvious here), DIG ROOF (very tricky), TAKE EARTH, E, UNLOCK DOOR (with the key), OPEN IT, S, TAKE WAND, N, E (you can pass the vampire because you have a garlic), S, S, S, CUT ROPE, TAKE IT, N, EXAMINE DOOR (it looks very weak), BREAK IT, E, TURN RING (to open a secret passage), TAKE IT (it is fastened), BREAK IT, TAKE IT, GO PASSAGE, TIE ROPE TO RING (else the rope will not carry far enough), KNOT IT (else the rope will be too slippy to climb), THROW IT, GO ROPE, D, EXAMINE WIZARD, TAKE STRENGTH, S, CAST STRENGTH (else you can not pick the boulder), TAKE BOULDER (to unblock a way), GO PASSAGE, THROW BOULDER AT OGRE (to kill him), D, E, N, D, SWIM, EXAMINE BODY, TAKE EARTH, TAKE TIN, OPEN IT (it seems empty), EXAMINE IT (tricky - a spell is tucked in the lining of the box), TAKE TELEPORT, E, THROW SOAP AT SLIME (to break up the slime), TAKE BUCKET, FILL IT WITH SLIME (you must empty a pit to enter the pit, because the slime is agressive), E, E, EMPTY IT (this is the only place where you can empty the slime without any danger, due to grille in the floor), W, W, FILL IT WITH SLIME, E, E, EMPTY IT, W, W, FILL IT WITH SLIME, E, E, EMPTY IT (a blast spell will appear; note that it is possible to break grille before pouring the slime, and this will reveal a new location under the grille, where you can find a gold bar and a diamond; this is a trap, because if you break the grille, a blast spell will not appear), TAKE BLAST, W, W, FILL BUCKET WITH SLIME (a pit is finnaly empty), GO PIT, TAKE SCEPTRE, U, E, N, EXAMINE CURTAINS (to reveal a secret passage), GO PASSAGE, TAKE CHALK (needed for drawing a pentagram), N, THROW SLIME AT GIANT (to kill him), TAKE HARP, S, S, S, W, DROP BUCKET (it is too wide to fit down the passage), W, SWIM, U, S, E, CAST BLAST (to cause an explosion, so the lava will drain away), PUT PLANKS ACCROSS CHANNEL, GO PLANKS (but the planks will fall down after this), CAST BLAST (to break the dam, and stop rising the lava), PULL LEVER (to move the drawbridge down - don't forget it, else you will not cross the channel later), TOUCH WAND TO PENTACLE (both the wand and the pentacle are red - this is meaning of one of the obscure hints on the scroll), EXAMINE PICTURE (it is picture of waves, but another obscure hint on the scroll is wave to wave), WAVE WAND TO PICTURE (you escaped from the caves, and you are now in a mystical hall;

the earth spell will help), CAST EARTH (the wizard will send a ball of flame; the ice wall spell will help), CAST ICE WALL (the wizard will send a strange cast at your mind; the mind shield spell will help), CAST MIND SHIELD (the wizard will send a cloud to you; the wind spell will help), CAST WIND (the wizard will start to crystalise the air; the shatter spell will help), CAST SHATTER (the air will start to vibrate with a strange sound; playing the magic harp will help), PLAY HARP (a wizard will send a lightning again), CAST EARTH (the wizard will send the intensive light at you; the polished shield will help), REFLECT LIGHT (the wizard will be temporarily blind), WAVE ROD (to weak the wizard; the wizard will say "BE NOT" and you will cease to exist), THINK (you think, therefore you are - cogito ergo sum; now the wizard will utter a curse, the bless spell will help), CAST BLESS (the wizzard will summon his demon master; drawing a pentagram will help - a hint from the runes), DRAW PENTAGRAM (you are protected), WAVE ROD (the wizard is finnaly dead), E, TAKE ORB AND CROWN, W, N, GO DRAWBRIDGE, W, TOUCH WAND TO PENTACLE, WAVE WAND TO PICTURE, E, E, E, E, N, GO WINDOW, D, S, S, S, S, S, E, E, E, E (you have completed the entire adventure).

!!! Hints:

* Do exactly what is described in the solution, without many improvisation.   This game is very deadly, and any wrong move can often be lethal. Especially  be careful in the wizard-killing procedure: any wrong move is deadly!
* Wawing rod before "becoming a not" is necessary, although it seems that any   another move has the same effect. But, without wawing, the wizard will not   be enough weak later, so when you try to wave rod after drawing a pentagram,   he will simply erase the part of the pentagram, and the demon will kill you.   So, you must attack him with the rod twice: before becoming a not, and after   drawing a pentagram (as described in the solution).
* Avoid wandering through the blizzard without wearing a robe. You will be   frozen very soon.
* Obligately download a map. The game is huge, and a map will help a lot.
* Avoid the room with zombie guards. A question whether it is possible to get   past the zombie guards is still open, but I believe that this is just another   trap.
* In the location called "Ruins of a temple", south and east from the yeti,   there's a stone that is covering a passage. You can enter this passage using   BREAK STONE, MOVE STONE and GO PASSAGE (discovered by Arlansky). You will   find yourself in a Crypt under the Temple, and going east you will enter the   Maze of Catacombs where lies a small silver obelisk. The Maze doesn't take   anywhere and it seems that the only way to get out from it (or from the   Crypt) is the teleport spell, so it seems just a false track, maybe the  obelisk doesn't have any use.
* After you have used both the blast spells, if you go back to the "Desecrated   Temple" you will find another one examining the priest once again. But, it   seems that there is no usage of this (also discovered by Arlansky).

!!! Comment:

Amazingly hard game. It was solved once before by Mike Gerrard, Ruth Golding and Jonathon Borer. Mike prepared a hint sheet for this game, whick was published in his book, and in one of the adventure pages for in 'Your Sinclair' magazine. This hint sheet is also typed in by Ian Preston, and displayed within the 'Spectrum Adventurer' web pages at:

http://home.virtual-pc/isblpx/index.html

But, it seems that this hint sheet is not enough. This game is full of hard (like skining the yeti) or obscure puzzles (like throwing soap at slime). Some of puzzles are even quite unfair, like diging the roof in rooms where nothing suggests to do it, taking a shield in the room in which a shield is not explicitely described as visible object, looking in a tin which is raported as "empty" on opening, etc. Fortunately, a lot of hard puzzles are described in the hint sheet, but some of the worst puzzles are not mentioned. In according to e-mails which I received, a lot of people were stuck on the same place where I was stuck: after becoming-a-not. It seems that THINKing (cogito ergo sum) was the puzzle which without doubt caused a lot of headaches. From the technical point of the view, the game is relatively good: a big map, lot of good pictures, good descriptions and atmosphere, and quite acceptable dictionary (over 200 words). The parser is not limited only to verb and noun, sometimes more words are needed (for example, WET ROBE WITH SNOW), although it is not very inteligent. Generally, this game will be remembered in my mind as one of the hardest adventure games I played on the Spectrum.
