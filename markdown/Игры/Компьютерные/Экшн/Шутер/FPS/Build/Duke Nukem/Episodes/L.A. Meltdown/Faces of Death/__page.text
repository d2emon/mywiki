Faces of Death is a Dukematch level in Duke Nukem 3D, grouped with the levels in Episode One, L.A. Meltdown. Despite being a multiplayer-only level, it could be reached in-game from the singleplayer mode as if it were a regular secret level. The problem there is that being designed for multiplayer, there is no exit button, and once a player reaches the level, they are trapped there forever. In the original PC-DOS version of the game, the only way to get to this level was with command line parameters, though it could be reached in later versions through a glitch involving the hidden exit button in the level The Abyss. Faces of Death was later altered for the PlayStation release, Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown, in which it became a regular secret level, complete with an exit; in Total Meltdown, the secret exit for it can be found in Alienz Rendevouz which is a level in the Exclusive Plug and Pray episode. The Walkthrough for this level will be based on the PSX version at its impossible to complete in the PC version.

!!! Summary

Faces of Death has a very simple design, consisting mainly of a large ring, with several floors. The only enemies in the level are Mini Battlelords, of which there are many. The name of the level comes from its primary distinguishing feature: arranged on the main floor around the ring are water tanks containing specialized sprites, space suits with faces displayed in the helmets. Going to the top floor and finding the top of the tanks will reveal another picture of the appropriate face, and a nameplate. The faces in the spacesuits are all digitized photos of 3D Realms staff members. The level is set in space and appears to be some sort of alien space station.

!!! How to get to the level in the PC version

In the circular room just before the player gets to the Battlelord in The Abyss, there is a section with three Ripper ammo packs. Behind this section is the secret exit. When players hit the button, they will be taken to Launch Facility, even if they previously completed it before getting to the Abyss initially. After completing Launch Facility, they will be taken back to the start of the Abyss. The player will have go through The Abyss again till they get to the same secret exit; this time, it takes the player to Faces Of Death. According to 3D Realms, this level technically has a level exit because the game wouldn't recognize Faces Of Death as a valid level without it.

!!! Easter eggs

If the player uses the show map cheat; if they look around the Map they'll see three small letters that spell AHB; which is the initials of Allen H. Blum III ; the designer of this level; the letters are a good bit apart from the main areas of this level..

!!! Trivia

In the PC version the player actually has to hit the secret exit twice in The Abyss to get to Faces Of Death. The 1st time takes them to Launch Facilty; after they complete that; they go back to the start of the Abyss and then the 2nd time round when they hit the secret exit; only then are they taken to Faces Of Death.
