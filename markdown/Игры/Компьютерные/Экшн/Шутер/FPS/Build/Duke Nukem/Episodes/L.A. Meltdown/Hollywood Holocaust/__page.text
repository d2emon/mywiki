!! Hollywood Holocaust

Hollywood Holocaust is where Duke Nukem 3D begins. After ejecting from his shot skycar, Duke Nukem lands on the roof of a building, and then drops down to the alien-infested street below.

The main feature of this level is the adult cinema. It can be entered either through a fire escape which leads into the one large cinema screen in the building, or by blowing a hole in the ticket office at the front of the building. The cinema contains one cinema screen, a lobby, some toilets, an arcade and a projection room.
