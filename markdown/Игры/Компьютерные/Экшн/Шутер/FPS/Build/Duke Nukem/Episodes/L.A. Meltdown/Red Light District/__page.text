!! Red Light District

The 2nd level of Duke Nukem 3D. Based on Duke's reputation, one had to know he'd make his way to the Red Light District. The level begins with Duke riding the elevator he blew up at the end of level 1 down to the bottom of the shaft. Duke then makes his way out into the open street, where many pig cops, as well as a pig cop aircraft, greet him. Duke makes his way into "Forbidden Videos and Books," where he enters a code to get into the owner's apartment. Inside, the blue key can be found. Duke then makes his way to the other end of the "S" shaped road (one end being the starting point) where he finds the blue key switch. This triggers another set of switches to rise, and the correct code triggers the building across the street to be demolished.

Duke makes his way through the rubble and finds the yellow key card (as well as a manhole cover which leads to the sewers, a secret area). Duke makes his way back to the yellow key door and enters the club. Inside, many pig cops are there to "check his weapons" and maybe use them against him! Duke clears the room, and makes his way to the bar area, where the red key card is located in a cabinet behind the bar. This key opens the strip club, noted by the large garage door. When in the strip club, look for a vent high on the wall in one of the corners. This vent takes Duke backstage, where he can jump on many crates and make his way to the attic. The nuke button is in sight, but as Duke ventures towards it, he is trapped by the pig cops, who exclaim: "We're gonna fry your ass, Nukem!"

Oh well, I guess its off to Death Row...
