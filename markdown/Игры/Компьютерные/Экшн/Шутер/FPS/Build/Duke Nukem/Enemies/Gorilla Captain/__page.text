The Gorilla Captain, along with the King Cobra is one of two new enemies introduced in the Duke Nukem 3D Duke Xtreme expansion.

!!! Description

He is a gorilla with red shorts, a green combat top and a green beret. He has ammo wrapped around his top and his main and only armament is a mortar launcher.

He only appears in the Duke Xtreme levels if the option to include him is enabled.

!!! Combat Analysis

His mortar attacks work in exactly the same way as the Battlelord's, but the difference is that the Gorilla Captain will always fire mortars no matter how close or far away the player is, since he has no other attacks and much like the Battlelords, there's no defined speed or limit and where the mortar is going to hit will be based around the player's position. He takes a bit more punishment than the Assault Commander and like the Assault Commander he can be likened to a mini boss.
