!!! Uranium Mines Walkthrough Part 1

!!!! Part 1:
There is a boarded up passage just to the left of the point at which you start this level. Use dynamite or your crossbow to blow the boards off. Doing so will open up the passage and expose a door. Go through the door into the main drilling room (don't jump down the mine shaft or you'll die). At the far end of this room is an alcove with a switch in it. Activate the switch and then go back out to the main entrance. Back at the main entrance, you'll find that a supply room is now open. Just inside the doorway on the wall there is a swtich. Activating that switch will open the wire gate in front of the elevator. Once the gate is open, take the elevator down to the next level of the mine.

When the elevator stops, you'll be in a small cave. Look for a partially obscured ladder embedded in one wall. Climb this up to a secret alcove where you can obtain a crossbow. Drop back down and then follow the main tunnel to the next section of the big drill. Here, look for a crack in the wall to the right. Blow up this wall to open up the passage ahead. Follow this passage until you reach a room with mine carts moving back and forth.

Taking care not to get hit by the carts, navigate this room and follow the passage on the far side till you reach a set of tracks leading downhill. Follow these tracks until you reach an L-section with two more moving carts. Again, taking care not to get hit by the carts, follow the first one until you can sidestep onto the next section of track. Now, follow the second cart until you can drop off the right of the track to the area below.

Here you need to look for a ladder that will take you up to a platform overlooking these two moving mine carts. After the 2nd cart has gone past, drop back down and continue following the tracks. Eventually, you will reach a stationary mine cart, beyond which is a mine cart moving back and forth. Hop up on the stationary cart, then jump up on the wooden beam above you. From this wooden beam, hop to the next beam. Once the cart has gone by beneath you, it is safe to drop back down and continue following the tracks. If you'd like an extra challenge, jump to the third beam and then look to your left for a rocky outcropping. Jump to this spot and drop down the hole to the secret cave below. Here you'll find a switch that will open up half of the bars holding the Vixen Teat Gun (the gun is located beyond a low passage in the water area below the main tracks...the switch there controls the other half of the bars).

After you've navigated past the last moving mine cart, you'll come to a broken section of tracks that is above a pool of water. Continue forward into the large cavern with a bridge crossing some more water. Entering this room will spring a trap, and several Billy Ray's will charge out of exploding walls, so be ready. Once you've defeated all of the enemies here, look for a brick lined passage leading off the main cavern. This passage will lead to a room with a crate in the corner. On the crate is the key that operates the elevator down to the next level of the mines.

Now, to find your way back out of this area you'll need to drop into the water below the bridge. Explore the underwater areas till you find a cavern with water flowing down into another lower passage. Drop down the small waterfall and then immediately turn to face the way you came. Just to the left of the waterfall you'll see another tunnel. Follow this into a small cave and climb up the rocks there. Use the ladder above the doorway to climb up to the level above.

Eventually, you'll come out on a rocky shelf overlooking the mine tracks. Follow the ledge there around to the left until you reach a gap. Jump the gap and continue along the ledge up into the caverns above. Look for a cave with a door and a switch (marked AREA 11). Unlock the door with the switch, then go through and back to the main entrance of this section of the mines. You can now use the key to activate the 2nd lift and go down to the next level below. End Part 1.

!!!! Begin Part 2:
After retrieving the first key, take the elevator down to the next level of the mine. When the elevator comes to a stop, follow the tunnel to the left. This will lead to an intersection. Ahead of you will be a passage blocked by a wire gate. To the right will be a passage blocked by some boards. To the left is an open passage.

Climb the boards that are blocking the passage to your right. At the top you'll find a small secret area. Explore this area, then drop back down and follow the open passage to the left. This will lead down hill and eventually stop at a dead end. Here you'll find a dynamite plunger on the ground. You'll need to crouch and hit your activate key on the plunger (before doing this though, it's a good idea to have RUN MODE turned on, and even have some moonshine ready if needed).

The plunger will trigger a cave in, so run as fast as you can back up the passage. When all of the quaking and shaking has finished, go back down the tunnel to the site of the cave-in. Here you'll discover a new passage has opened up. Beyond this passage is a room with another plunger. Activate this plunger in the same manner as the first (don't worry, no cave-in this time), then make your way back up to the main intersection (you'll probably have to do a bit of fighting between these steps). At the main intersection, you'll discover that one corner of the rock has been blown away to expose the large mine drill. Embedded against the far wall next to the drill is a switch. This will open the wire gate blocking the forward passage of the intersection.

After unlocking the gate, continue down the forward tunnel. This tunnel will end at a mine cart positioned below a chute. From this point, take the tunnel immedieately to your left and follow it up and around to the room above. In the center of this room is the upper portion of the chute. Hop down into the chute and you'll land in the cart below (where you'll retrieve the 2nd key).

After obtaining the second key, follow the tunnel back up to the main entrance where the two elevators are. Continue past the elevators to another large cavernous area (and another exploding Billy Ray trap). In this cavern is a mining machine with a switch on the side of it. The second key will activate this switch, which will cause the machine to bore a hole through the rock wall of the cavern.

Using your crouch key, crawl through this newly created hole. In the room beyond, you'll find the third key. Obtain the key and go back the way you came. Use the third key on the next elevator and ride down to the last level of the mines. End Part 2.

!!!! Begin Part 3:
After obtaining the 3rd key, ride the elevator down to the lowest portion of the mine. You'll end up at a natural cavern with a pool of water and a waterfall. Next to the waterfall is a ladder. On one side of the cavern is a tunnel marked SECRIT ALEYN BASS. If you go down this side tunnel you'll trigger a very rapid cave-in. Many people will want to avoid this altogether, but if you feel up to the challenge, there is a Goo-Goo Cluster and some saw-blade ammo at the end of the tunnel. To successfully retrieve them, you'll need to activate your moonshine just as the cave-in starts. You should have just enough time to grab the goods and then dash out of the tunnel.

Whether or not you decide to go after the Goo-Goo Cluster, you will need to climb the ladder along side of the waterfall. At the top of the waterfall is another large cavern. In an alcove in the wall is a switch. Activate this switch and then drop back into the lower cavern. Now, walk through the center of the waterfall (directly below the outcrop of rock) and into a secret tunnel beyond. This tunnel will lead to the actual secret base.

When you enter the Alien Base, you will be sealed inside (along with some very angry aliens). After dispatching all of the enemies, exploring the area will reveal four central switches, and a fifth switch in a lower room. The four main switches are all marked with a + sign, while the fifth switch is marked with an = sign. Solve the puzzle by arranging the switches so that 1+1+1+1=4.

After all of the switches are in the correct position, a central chamber will open up, revealing the main drill site. In this room is a switch marked EXIT. Activate that switch, and then go back out the way you came (the entrance should now be open again). Ride all of the elevators back up to the main starting point of this level. You'll find that the doors of the mine are now open, and Bubba is there waiting for you. Grab your crowbar and give him a whack upside his head to end the level.
