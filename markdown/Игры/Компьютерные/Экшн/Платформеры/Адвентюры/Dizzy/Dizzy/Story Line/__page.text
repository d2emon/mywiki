!! Dizzy: The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure

Dizzy was exploring the haunted forest, looking for some berries, flowers and a piece of wood with which to make a club when he uncovered a mystifying stone slab. 
Brushing the dirt aside he was able to read (after a great deal of head scratching) the faint inscription 'The Avawiffovee Potion'.

 
Dizzy remembered his Eggfather had spoke of such a potion. 'It is the only way to rid our land of athletes foot, and it can also be used to destroy the Evil Wizard Zaks'.
Dizzy trembled with fear as he recalled these words. Zaks brought fear to the village, he cast spells that turned people old, made men blind and caused it to rain every Sunday afternoon during Cricket.


Dizzy was determined to put a stop to all this, he would be the hero of the yolkfolk. He read on... 'Fill a potion bottle with cooked Leprechauns wig, cloud silver lining, Vampire dux feather and some troll brew - cook the potion and throw it at Zaks to dissolve his reign.' He covered it up and quickly made ready to liberate the land of KATMANDU.
