!! Rackham

Everyone knows the French company that produces those lovely Confrontation figures by now. Do they produce pirates? Hell no, but they have a full goblin clan box called the "Skimmers of the Oceans", which holds 9 splendid goblin pirates and a cannon. Well... 8 goblins, a monkey and a cannon, but anyway... The crew is made up of a captain with suitably large hat, a sorcerer wearing a squid on his head, a first mate with parrot, a goblin diver, 2 regular crew with halberds/harpoons, 2 gunners and the aforementioned monkey who answers to the name of "Baron Samedi". The regular crew and gunners are also available in separate blisters. A further addition to this crew can be found in the mercenary Ogre Boutefeu. After all, he does have a goblin pirate cannon and crew mounted on his shoulders. Lastly, the Black Troll is swinging an anchor for his weapon and could be included in your crew.
