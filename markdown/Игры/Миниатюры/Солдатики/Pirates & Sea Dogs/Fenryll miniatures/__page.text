!! Fenryll miniatures

This French company specialises in fantasy miniatures, made out of resin instead of metal. The figures come with integral square bases. Pirates are few, but they are there nonetheless. The adventurers section has "Surcouf le Pirate" with his accessories, while the dwarf section has three dwarf buccaneers. There's also a pack of very nice skeletal pirates.
