!! Fortress

Now, one thing we didn't run into yet, is a range of ratmen pirates. But that would be crazy, no? Still, Fortress has just that with the "Pirats" in their "Funny Animals" line. There's a slightly humouristic edge to this figures but they look nice, especially when it comes to the Pirat captains. These are cast in lead free pewter and come with resin bases. The range includes dueling pirats, pirats with melee & pistols and pirats with blackpowder guns.
