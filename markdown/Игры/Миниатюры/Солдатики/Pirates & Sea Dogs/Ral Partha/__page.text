!! Ral Partha

Officially dead, this oldtimer of miniature companies lives on as Ral Partha Europe and Ironwind Metals (in the US). There can still be found a few pirates in the vast mass of fantasy miniatures produced by RP. They're in the "Heroes and Horrors" range, which has a pack of 'pirates and sailors'.
