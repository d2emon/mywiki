!! Warrior Miniatures

They claim to supply more figures to the pound than any other manufacturer and at 40p for foot and 80p for cavalry models I'm willing to believe that. They were established in 1973 and unfortunately many models in the range show their age. This goes for the "Treasure Island" range as well, which includes miniatures for the main characters from the novel and some generic pirates.
