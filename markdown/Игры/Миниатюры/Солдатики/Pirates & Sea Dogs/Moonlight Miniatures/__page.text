!! Moonlight Miniatures

Moonlight Miniatures produces two ranges of Skeletal pirates. One in 34mm and one in 28mm. You can check out our review of the 34mm range here. Like their larger brethren, the 28s are sculpted in a slightly cartoony style that somehow oozes character in a way that makes some technically more realistic figures seem dull and bland in comparison. If skelly pirates are your thing, this is a range to look at.
