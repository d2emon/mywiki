!! SculptDur

A small, but growing collection of pirate figures by sculptor Ren√© Durand (of Quebec). The figures are perhaps more aimed at the collector than the gamer, but should find a place in your collection easily enough. The Goblin pirate cap'tain (27mm sole to eye) is a must for any fantasy pirate range.
