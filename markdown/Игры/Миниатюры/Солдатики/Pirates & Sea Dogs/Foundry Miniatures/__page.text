!! Foundry Miniatures

The Foundry has quite some excellent pirate models in the "Swashbucklers & High Renaissance" range, with many historical figures, such as the infamous Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard), characters from the classic "Treasure Island" and plenty more of the greatest scum that ever sailed the seven seas. The ranges also include cannons and crews, casualties, black marauders and Chinese pirates.

If you want more of a fantasy feel to your games, you should also look at their War Orcs. Many of those (the ones without armour), actually look a lot like pirates and could be used to crew a ship of sailing greenskin cutthroats.

The Foundry website also has a set of useful articles on pirates and building Flagship Games pirate ships.

"It might be worth a mention that the best (IMO) article on the Foundry site is a .pdf reprint of Gary Chalk's piece from Wargames Illustrated #138 on how to *scratchbuild* brigantines from card and wood, with full-size templates. Just the thing for those who are frugal yet crafty!" - aecurtis.
