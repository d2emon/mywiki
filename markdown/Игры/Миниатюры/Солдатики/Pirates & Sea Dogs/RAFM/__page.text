While I couldn't find any pirates in their historical range, the fantasy range has a few nice figures in the "Player Characters" section, being a "complete" pirate, with eyepatch, pegleg and parrot (only the hook is missing, but that would be a bit overkill perhaps...) and a dashing female pirate. These figures come with solid metal bases.
