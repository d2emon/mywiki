!! Crusader Miniatures

The company of the talented Mark Sims, formerly of the Foundry. Crusader miniatures offers a small range of pirates and a most original one at that, as they're pirate orcs. The range is called "The Uncharted Lands", and features some dwarves as well, although those look less piratelike. The orcs are nice though, with 8 variants available, four with muskets and four with swords and pistols.

"Height wise, they are very similar to the foundry ones but the foundry ones are slightly fatter. Still they can be easily mixed." - sgt. fatgoblin
