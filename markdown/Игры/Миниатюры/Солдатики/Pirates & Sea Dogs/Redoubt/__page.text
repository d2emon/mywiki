!! Redoubt

Another large manufacturer of historical miniatures. Now, there are good miniatures and there are bad miniatures. With Redoubt it's a matter of taste. Some, like myself don't care for the style of many of their lines, while others swear they're the finest minis available. Who's right, I don't know. I do know they have a line of pirates. Are they any good? Hard to say. The Redoubt catalog still uses drawings to illustrate the minis instead of the actual minis, which makes it hard to judge what they really look like. The pirate range includes pirates (naturally), gun crews, female pirates, civilian captives (men and women) and dead or drunken pirates...
