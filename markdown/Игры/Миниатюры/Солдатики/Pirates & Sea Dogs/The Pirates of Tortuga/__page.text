!! The Pirates of Tortuga

In 1669 pirates, led by Henry Morgan captured the Spanish treasure town of  Maracaibo.

Planned by Morgan as a punitive raid , it developed into a terror-filled orgy of  murder, pillage ,and rape.

Some of the subjects are brutal , some may even be X-rated .But all are vital representations of the era .
