Aka that company which shall not be named. As a Showcase first I have decided to throw them a bone and include them in this showcase as they don't have any real Pirate range anyway and it might not be a bad idea to point out the useful models. Unfortunately we can't show you any pictures, not to infringe on their IP.

Suitable GW pirate figures are Long Drong's dwarven slayer pirates from the WFB "Dogs of War range" and to a lesser extent the (plastic) Empire militia set. From the Mordheim range we particularly direct attention to the Vampire Countess Marianna Chevaux, which would look great commanding a crew of undead pirates.
