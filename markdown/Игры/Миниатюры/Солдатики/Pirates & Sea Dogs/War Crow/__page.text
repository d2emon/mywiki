!! War Crow

A small range of fantasy miniatures from the makers of Corvus Belli historicals. They have one model that could qualify as a pirate, albeit a somewhat unusual one. It's a female mini called "Fujiko da Silva" and it is said that she is the daughter or a Portuguese pirate and a geisha. Of course, we don't believe everything that's 'said', but she does look the part.
