The Home Alone movie house has always been one of my favorites, so I was excited when a reader named Eric shared photos he took inside the real home in Winnetka, Illinois, with me. He says the owners were kind enough to allow him to take these in 2004. Let’s see how they look compared to the rooms that were recreated on a soundstage for the movies!

!!! The Staircase in Home Alone:

Let’s take a look at the entry first. The above photo is how it looked in Home Alone 2. Below is a snapshot I took in the original movie. Notice the changes they made, like how there are fewer family photos on the wall going up the stairs?

!!! Here’s how the living room with the piano looked in the movie:

Director Christopher Columbus says he was striving to make a film that looked timeless. “We intended the film to feel like Christmas, so we filled the house with greens and reds. I wanted the house to feel like a warm place.”

Macaulay Culkin points out in the DVD commentary that in real life he would have crashed into the wall if he really attempted to sled down the stairs and out the front door.

He didn’t get any photos of the real kitchen, but you can see it and more rooms here.

Despite the resemblance between the actual rooms and the ones in the films, few of the interior scenes were shot inside the real house. Director Christopher Columbus talks in the DVD commentary about recreating the interiors on a sound stage in a high school gymnasium, and a source tells me that they used the nearby New Trier High School, which was vacant at the time.

Ceilings appear to be 8′ in the actual house but are taller in the movie. The foyer is reportedly wider in the movie, too.

!!! The Home Alone house sits on Lincoln Avenue in Winnetka, Illinois and was recently on the market:

* 5 beds
* 3.5 bath
* 4,243 sqft
* Lot 23,278 square feet
* Built in 1920

Eric worked out some floor plans after visiting it:

Kevin drew his own floor plan when formulating his “Battle Plan.” Macaulay Culkin says that he remembers being given some Crayons to color some of it in and make it look “authentic.”

!!! They used potato flakes to make it look like it was snowing:
