!!! Features

Dashbard is an web based collaborative tool to magange and track your projects.

The basic features of Dashbard are

* Tasks to track dates and milestones for the project.
* Taskitems to track the time sepnt in the project on each task.
* Tracking and logging all changes in the project.
* Personal Todo lists available to all team members.
* Noticeboard, to keep conversation on the project with the project.
* Project specific Wiki, to share information in the team.
* Files, to securely share documents within the team.
* Multiple access levels, allowing people to act as owner, particpant or viewer in the project.

Dashbard has a rich set of features, but you do not need to use, or learn every feature for Dashbard to work for you. You may want to use only the task feature and never care about the wiki. Or vice versa.

Dashbard is based around giving people freedom, but tracking and logging changes so that the freedom is used responsibly. Dashbard tracks and logs all changes done to projects.

Using tasks and taskitems you can divide large projects into smaller managable chunks, and delegate each task or taskitem to a team member.

!!! Benefits

At Dashbard everything is versioned, and everything is logged. This means that you can give access to your project with the fear of it being used maliciously. Multiple access levels means that people with auxilary roles can be invited as viewers.

!!! Access Levels

People with acess to a project can be either viewer, participant or owners of the project. Viewers can see everything in a project, but they can not make edits to the project. Partcipant can create and edit tasks, task items, wiki pages, notices and files. The owner can make project level changes, such as making the project inactive. Inviting other users to the project, and removing a user from the project.

!!! Tasks

Tasks are the real workhorse of Dashbard. They allow you to break a project into smallers managable chunks, and allow each task to be assigned to a person. A task has start and ent date when you estimate it to start. It has a user responsible who is the person responsible for finishing the task. Once the task is complete, you can enter actual start and end dates, to track the slippage on the tasks.

Like everything else Tasks are versioned and logged. When you create a task this information is looged, and is accesible from the Logs tab. When you edit a task the previous version is saved, and anew version is created. You can see all the previous versions and roll back to any version of the task.

Tasks can have a hierachy, any level deep. This can be used to track and manage depenendancy of tasks. For example, if your team is divided into subteams, the team leads can be made responsible for the top level tasks. The other team members can have tasks, which are subtasks of the top level tasks.

!!! Taskitems

Tasks are a good way to manage and track dates when a part of the project needs to be completed, and a way to delegate responsibility. When you want to manage the time spent on the project, taskitems are a good fit. If tasks have dates, task items have Time spent.

!!! Todo

We have a confession to make. When we said that everything in Dashbard is versioned and logged, we were not being entirely truthful, Todos are not versioned or tracked. But this is a good thing as, you will see in a moment.

Once you have been assigned some work, you might want to divide that work into smallers chunks. But you might not want to share this information with everyone else. Todos are a way for you to track yourself. Anything you do here is visible to you only.

Todo Lists can contain Todo Items. As you complete your tasks, you may keep on making your todo items complete. When a new job is assigned to you, you would create a new Todo List. When the job is fully complete, you can make the List complete and the List is removed from your Todo page.

Todos are not versioned as they are meant to be personal. They help you manage yourself.

!!! Wiki

Wikis are a great way for your team to collaborate. They serve as a platform where the team can share information or capture freeform infomration. As the information changes the wiki pages can be modified by your team members. The ability to see changes made by everyone, and the ability to rollback, if mistakes happen give the courage to be bold.

!!! Calendar

Calendars show the tasks in a easier to understand and digest view. Each calendar shows the tasks which start and end on a specific day. You can drill down to any month and then access tasks starting on those days.

!!! Noticeboard

Did you ever have a comunication with all your team mates, only to lose that email thread when you needed it most? Noticeboard is meant to remove this chaos, by keeping project specific notices with the project. When you add a notice, this notice is kept with the project in perpetuity.

!!! Logs

Logs are like the heartbeat of your project. Looking at them you can see how the project is progressing. Every change made to the project, and the person making the change is logged. These logs are available as RSS feeds or as emails. You can also access them from within the project using the Logs tab.

!!! Metrics

Metrics give you a high level overview of the project. They show the percent of tasks done, the percent of tasks which missed their deadline.
