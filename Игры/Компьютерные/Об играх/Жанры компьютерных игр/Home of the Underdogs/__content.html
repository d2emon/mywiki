<LI><B>Choose Your Own Adventure</B>
<BR>This subgenre includes IF titles that are stuctured like "Choose Your Own Adventure" books that were popular in the 1980s, in which you determine what to do next by choosing an action from multiple choices. Thanks to individual efforts like the LOTECHComp and Jon Ingold's excellent Adventure Book application, CYOA games are enjoying considerable popularity again.
<BR>If you enjoy these games, check out our Gamebooks page, especially the Free Gamebooks series for more CYOA games, both traditional (paper-based) and electronic formats.</LI>
<LI><B>Conventional</B>
<BR>Traditional interactive fiction titles, i.e. with a healthy dose of puzzles that are inventory-based.</LI>
<LI><B>Cross-genre IF</B>
<BR>IF titles that include significant elements from other genres, most usually RPGs.</LI>
<LI><B>Graphical IF</B>
<BR>Also known as "parser-based graphical adventures," graphical IF titles include graphics as a major component of the game. Oldie Sierra games based on AGI and SCI engines (e.g. Police Quest 1, King's Quest IV) are best examples of this subgenre. For graphical IF that are pure "interactive novels" without any puzzle (e.g. Portal), check out the Story-driven subgenre instead.</LI>
<LI><B>Monumental</B>
<BR>IF titles that are monumental in scope and size, requiring a good 20-30 hours or more to solve it. Make sure you have set aside a lot of free time before playing these games ;)</LI>
<LI><B>Multiple endings</B>
<BR>IF titles that boast a number of possible endings based on the player's actions during the game. Some, most notably Emily Short's Galatea, go so far as to offer literally dozens(!) of alternate endings.</LI>
<LI><B>Other IF</B>
<BR>IF titles that don't fit anywhere else, usually because they -- well -- don't fit anywhere else ;) Examples of these include Andrew Plotkin's excellent Lists and Lists, a game designed to teach the basics of programming.</LI>
<LI><B>Real-time IF</B>
<BR>Titles in which events take place in real time, without waiting for the player's input. Synapse's games are good examples of real-time IF. This subgenre also includes IF titles that are not played in real time, but which focus on timed puzzles or otherwise require astute timing to succeed (e.g. A Change in the Weather, Border Zone).</LI>
<LI><B>Short and sweet</B>
<BR>IF titles that can be finished in a very short period of time, anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. They are short, but they are excellent or else we wouldn't review them here-- check them out ;)</LI>
<LI><B>Story-driven</B>
<BR>Sometimes referred to as "experimental IF," story-driven IF are a new breed of IF titles that focus on storytelling rather than puzzle-solving. In these groundbreaking games, puzzles either take a backseat (e.g. Photopia) or are completely nonexistent (e.g. Exhibition). All of the games in this subgenre are noteworthy for their bold approach to the medium, and are well worth a look.</LI>
