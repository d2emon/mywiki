!!! 10 Incredibly Graphic Sex Scenes In Horror Movies 

It’s been a whole year since we looked at cinema’s most terrifying sex scenes, so we thought we’d take a look back at the most graphic sex scenes ever depicted in horror films! Obviously, everything that follows will be incredibly NSFW and contain some serious spoilers.

!!!! Friday the 13th (2009)

I don’t think I’ve ever laughed as hard in a horror movie as I did when I heard Travis Van Winkle tell Julianna Guill that her “tits were stupendous” and that she had “perfect nipple placement.” This is a ridiculous and fairly graphic sex scene! Unfortunately, the scene (pictured above) isn’t on YouTube, but you can find it on Pornhub (shocker), so that gives you an idea of just how graphic it is.

!!!! Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday

Last one from this franchise, but while Jason Goes To Hell is arguably the worst in the franchise (though I know it has its defenders), it features one of the most graphic sex scenes and kills out of all of the films (if you watch the unrated version).

!!!! Antichrist

Even though it was filmed with porn star body doubles, the opening scene of Lars Von Trier’s Antichrist is still extremely graphic. Actual penetration is seen. Of course, this is nothing to the third act clitoris snipping and blood ejaculation. The actual pornographic images are censored in the below clip. It is YouTube after all!

!!!! Don’t Look Now

This sex scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie is still considered graphic even by today’s standards, but it is a beautiful moment in Nicolas Roeg’s bleak and haunting film.

!!!! Salò, or The 120 Days of Sodom

It’s difficult to pin down just one graphic scene from Salo, which isn’t technically a horror film, but it is one of the most horrifying films I’ve ever seen. It is a difficult film to watch, but should be required viewing for everyone (just my opinion!) Really, the whole movie could qualify for this list, but here’s a small sample of what you’re in for if you decide to put this one on:

!!!! Hatchet 2

As graphic as it is hilarious, Hatchet 2 features one of the funniest deaths in all of horror history: AJ Bowen gets decapitated while having sex with Alexis Peters doggy style. After he is decapitated, his body begins convulsing, thereby hammering into Peters even harder, until she realizes she is getting penetrated by a corpse. It’s ridiculous and funny and disturbing all at the same time.

!!!! Brain Damage

While it’s not actual sex, it does feature a woman’s brain being eaten by a mutant penis as she attempts to perform fellatio on him. Fun!

!!!! A Serbian Film

Newborn baby rape and incest. What more do you need? A Serbian Film is one of the most difficult films I’ve ever had to watch, but I kind of love it. Start the video at the 11-minute mark to see the graphic scene. This is one of the biggest spoilers on this list so if you haven’t seen the film beware!

!!!! The Last House On The Left

It was a tough choice between this and I Spit On Your Grave, but in the end this one “won.” Both the original Wes Craven film and its remake feature rape scenes that are difficult to endure, but I think I have to give the edge to the remake on this one. The original makes you feel gross just because of the filming quality, but the remake (especially the unrated cut) features an extended rape scene that is absolutely grueling.

!!!! Tetsuo: The Iron Man

I wouldn’t necessarily call this one graphic. It’s just weird. The Iron Man’s body slowly morphs into metal, and in one of the weirdest scenes of the film, he discovers that his penis has become a large power drill. He proceeds to rape his girlfriend with it, killing her (obviously).

Obviously, this is just a small sample of graphic sex scenes in horror movies. I didn’t even mention Species or Otto! What are some of your favorites (if that’s not too weird a question to ask)?

!!! 8 A-Listers Who Bared it All in a Horror Film

I can sit back and harp on how all of us boys (young and old) love to soak up the sights of the female body. But that’s pointless. Everyone, man and woman alike, knows guys think with the wrong head on a near constant basis. So you’ll be spared a lengthy introduction in favor of a quick segue into a list that may surprise you.

'''Betsy Rue – My Bloody Valentine''': My Bloody Valentine was a shocker. To the delight of hardcores like myself, the remake proved to be highly entertaining, boasting a number of scenes that truly pop and some awesome atmosphere. One of those scenes happens to be a genuinely interesting nude scene featuring the well endowed and on-the-rise Betsy Rue (I know Betsy isn’t a certified A-lister yet, but she damn well could be soon, as she’s headed in the right direction and already sports some impressive credits), who runs from a motel room in the buff, only to walk directly into harm’s way. Things don’t end well for Betsy, but she can walk away from the filming experience knowing she’s one of the sexiest women to ever shoot an unbelievably awkward nude scene.

'''Scarlett Johansson – Under the Skin''': The last thing most of us expected from ScarJo was participation in a full frontal nude scene. But we got it earlier this year when the artsy but awesome Under the Skin invaded our homes. It’s a slow-paced flick, and it won’t work for every fan out there, but if you like slow burn psychological trips with jolting finales, you’ll cherish every minute. Especially the moments that feature Scarlett standing in a front of a mirror, not a shred of clothing on her. Uh, to die for!

'''Nastassja Kinski – To the Devil a Daughter''': Before Nastassja Kinski crept into American hearts via a string of solid films that included Cat People, Unfaithfully Yours, The Hotel New Hampshire and Golden Globe nominee Paris, Texas, she had eyes popping from skulls with her work in the serviceable but not stellar To the Devil a Daughter. These days the movie probably won’t do much for anyone other than, perhaps, Hammer fans, but Kinski certainly livens up the party. That can’t be denied.

'''Milla Jovovich – Resident Evil''': Oh, for an extension of this particular scene. Milla’s character Alice personifies badass heroine (seriously, Jovovich is the most confinving “tough girl” since Sigourney Weaver’s portrayal of Ellen Ripley in the Alien flicks). She’s also rather lovable, exhibiting a very feminine side from time to time. It makes for quite the desirable woman. And boys feeling any carnal desire had to be happy when we got a brief glimpse of her goodies in the original Resident Evil film. It’s not the greatest angle for inspection, and the scene doesn’t last too long, but horndogs had to love it all the same.

'''Sissy Spacek – Carrie''': There was nothing sexy about this scene, which seems like an absolute impossibility. 20-somethings playing high school chicks in a locker room, buck naked? What could go wrong? Everything. But the scene was important beyond words. It set the tone and established Carrie as a film that you absolutely had to see. After all, if Brian De Palma’s approach to that opener was any indication, viewers were in for a very extreme journey into the mind of a gifted but troubled teen. De Palma didn’t disappoint.

'''Charlize Theron – The Devil’s Advocate''': I’m still on the fence about this film. On one hand I thought Charlize Theron was excellent, and I thought the overall mood of the film was excellent. On the other hand I was surprisingly disappointed by Al Pacino’s work. It felt extremely standard, for lack of a more accurate term. Let’s say this; we didn’t see much from the man that we haven’t already, many times. Just the same, Keanu Reeves did turn in a fair performance (he proved surprisingly well suited for the role of Kevin Lomax), the writing is strong, and the idea of Satan spawning a kick-ass lawyer who goes on to inadvertently destroy a number of lives, including his own wife’s, as a result over ambition and a lust for power, is pretty damn engaging.

'''Ashley Judd – Bug''': Bug caught a nasty rep with fans quite early because frankly, the general voice seemed to want more bugs… actual bugs. But that’s not what Bug is about, at all, really. It’s a psychological story about two people who should have never encountered one another, coming together only to completely unravel. It’s a trippy piece, and despite what many fans will tell you, it’s actually really effective in creeping out the audience. It’s not Friedkin’s (yes, another William Friedkin flick makes the list) greatest, but it’s certainly not a film to write off without extending an opportunity to impress. At the very least, you’ll spot the stunning Ashley Judd fully nude.

'''Juno Temple – Killer Joe''': Killer Joe isn’t an outright horror film. It’s certainly more thriller than anything else. But it is an extremely dark production, it is one of Matthew McConaughey’s greatest performances and it is a film from the legendary William Friedkin, who gave us classics like The Exorcist and The French Connection. If you haven’t seen it, it comes recommended. Not just because of, but certainly in part due to, Juno Temple’s full frontal scene. It’s not a hyper-sexual moment, but this quirky young lady has one hell of a body that most won’t mind gazing at for a few moments.

!!! Blood, Guts and Boobs

When it comes to creating a recipe for a hit movie, what are two popular ingredients a budding filmmaker should always mix together? Sex and horror of course! Horror is one of the most popular movie genres in the world and sex sells, simple as that. 

In honor of all the naked people who died so that we could be entertained and grossed out, let’s take a look at the best horror movie nude scenes ever:

!!!! 1-Anna Hutchison in The Cabin in the Woods (2012)

Director and co-writer Drew Goddard has been recognized for this gifted deconstruction of the horror genre that also features a great movie twist. Some rank this flick as one of the greatest horror-comedies of all time in addition to possessing one of the best horror movie nude scenes courtesy of hot, naked Australian actress Anna Hutchison who sits atop a then unknown Chris Hemsworth before being butchered.

!!!! 2 - Natasha Henstridge in Species

For sci-fi fans who wonder about what it’s like to bone an alien, Natasha Henstridge as Sil the breeding alien-woman fulfills every fan boy’s fantasies. Natasha spends a good portion of the film naked and engaged in various sex scenes since her alien character’s main purpose is to make alien babies. At one point, she morphs into an alien creature as she’s having sex which is either rather frightening or erotic depending on where you stand on the idea of intergalactic poon-tang.

!!!! 3 - Julianna Guill in Friday The 13th (2009)?

No wonder the films in this series were so popular; how can you go wrong with a lot of sex and a lot of hacking of body parts by a very sexually frustrated Jason Voorhees? The 2009 version is a remake of the classic and features one of the hottest girls of horror, Julianna on top and in control.  Her partner clearly appreciates her naked assets since he spews such great dialogue like, "Your tits are stupendous," and "You got perfect nipple placement, baby."

!!!! 4 - Alyssa Milano in Embrace Of The Vampire

In the “child star proves she’s grown up by getting naked” category, Who’s The Boss? star Alyssa Milano not only goes naked but does full frontal nudity in this 1995 vampire movie. She plays a college co-ed whose sexual awakening is sparked by a ruthless vampire. Alyssa has a number of hot sex scenes throughout this movie which was interestingly directed by a woman, Anne Goursaud. A lot of sex must have ended up on the cutting room floor since a more graphic version of the film that is not rated was also released.

!!!! 5 - Monika M. in Nekromantik 2

Now considered a cult classic, NEKRomantik 2 is a 1991 German horror film that’s the sequel to director Jörg Buttgereit’s 1987 film Nekromantik. The movie is about necrophilia and apparently the German government didn’t approve of a movie about sex with corpses since the film was seized by Munich authorities 12 days after its initial release. What is so bad about a necrophiliac named Monika (played by an actress with the same name) who chops off the head of guy as she’s on top of him and then puts the decomposed head of her dead boyfriend where the guy’s head used to be? Maybe government officials drew the line when Monika rubbed the deceased’s blood all over her body before she intensively orgasms while riding the corpse. The Germans clearly don’t understand the meaning of cinematic art.

!!!! 6 - Anna Falchi in Dellamorte, Dellamore (Cemetery Man)

Proving it’s not only Americans that have sick minds, this Italian movie (directed by Michele Soavi, also a woman) stars Rupert Everett as a caretaker of a small Italian cemetery. He looks for love while battling annoying deceased people who keep rising from the dead. In another woman on top sex scene, Anna plays a widow who is bitten by her dead husband as she’s boning Rupert near her husband’s grave. But before she kicks the bucket, Anna’s breasts are displayed in full view in this strangely erotic sex scene which kind of makes copulating in a cemetery even more creepy and taboo.

!!!! 7 - Susan Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve in The Hunger

For vampire fans, The Hunger is a?1983 erotic horror vampire movie showcasing two MILFS in their heyday.  In addition to the hot lesbian scene between Susan and Catherine, there’s a nice bisexual love triangle involving the two ladies and David Bowie who plays Catherine’s vampire companion. Catherine is a female vampire who seduces Susan using the old spilled wine trick and before pouncing on her. The ensuing sensual sex scene shows the intensity of discovering another person’s body for the first time and how it really sucks to be bitten by a vampire.

!!!! 8 - Michelle Clunie in Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday 

Sex has always played a major role in the Friday the 13th movies as evidence by Jason making our list twice. But none of the other films has a sex scene quite like 1993’s Jason Goes To Hell. Michelle Clunie plays a camper getting her freak on in the middle of the woods in a tent with a guy. She’s so horny that she actually has sex with a tent stake before climbing on top of her man. The couple are having steamy and at times, graphic sex when mid-coitus, Michelle gets hacked in two by Jason resulting in the ultimate buzzkill.

!!!! 9 - Lisa Bonet in Angel Heart

This 1987 film was made when Mickey Rourke could actually play the leading man instead of the monster in a horror movie.  Leaving The Cosby Show behind, this satanic thriller showcases Lisa Bonet in a sex scene with a normal faced Mickey Rourke in a leaky New Orleans hotel room. Things are getting steamy between the two nude lovebirds when blood starts to rain down on them. And we’re not talking the monthly visitor type of blood. It literally starts to rain blood. Talk about gross and messy.

!!!! 10 - Betsy Rue in My Bloody Valentine 3D  

The biggest gripe about this 2009 horror flick is that it doesn’t fully capitalize on 3D technology in all its glory and disappointed moviegoers who were hoping for dismembered boobs, gushes of blood and body parts flying off the screen and into their faces.  However the film does get the 3D right in an early scene when after having sex in a motel room, a completely nude Betsy Rue chases the killer around. Pity the killer gets the best of poor Betsy and eventually kills her in all her naked glory.

!!!! 11 - Anna Lynne McCord in Excision

In this erotic horror film, Anna Lynne McCord plays the main character, Pauline who is often intensely aroused by violent and disturbing fantasies. Fans of filmmaking techniques rave about how well the fantasies are shot with contrasting colors and breathtaking angles. Fans of sexual techniques rave about how Pauline awakes from each blood-soaked sexual dream panting in an orgasmic state as she dreams about herself and others being mutilated with excessive amounts of blood.  

!!!! 12 - Valerie Hartman in Sleepaway Camp 2: Unhappy Campers  

This 1988 film is the sequel to Sleepaway Camp (1983) which many consider to have one of the best shocker endings in the slasher genre.  Sleepaway Camp II (spoiler alert!) starts with the revelation of the transvestite killer from the first film who’s been recently released from an insane asylum for criminals.  This is never good for anybody who is camping especially camp counselors who expose their breasts like slutty Ally played by Valerie Hartman.  At least Ally gets off courtesy of a fellow camp counselor in a bathroom stall before being offed by the Caitlyn Jenner wanna-be.

!!! 9 Movies With Way Too Much Gratuitous Nudity

Ever since humanity learned to doodle on the walls of the caves it called home, we have been treated to depictions of sex and the human body in art. It is hardwired into our DNA to enjoy the sexual act, and it’s nearly impossible to look away when we see it presented on screen.

Filmmakers who portray sex and nudity in their pictures walk a fine line: if you can justify the inclusion of bare skin, like the recent Palme d’Or winner Blue Is The Warmest Colour, a feature that chronicles the love affair between an underage student and her female teacher in graphic detail, then you have earned respectability while also appealing to the baser desires of moviegoers; however, if you fail to justify excessive amounts of nudity and sex in your feature, then you have crossed the line from being an artist to a purveyor of smut, like Zalman King.

For your consideration, I present a list of 9 films that crossed the line from art to smut and never looked back, movies that threw as much T & A at the screen as possible for the sake of it: 9 movies with way too much gratuitous sex and nudity.
 
!!!! 9. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story

A hilarious parody of musical biopics, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story skewered the tendency for biographical films about musicians to ignore the music and instead wallow in the excesses of the Rock ‘n’ Roll lifestyle. The film satirises the gratuitous nudity and sex this trope entails by showing the titular rock star, Dewey Cox, engaging in all manners of sexual excess, including orgies and wife swapping.

While it failed to recoup its budget at the box office, Walk Hard won over critics and strong word of mouth led to a cult following and significant DVD sales. The theatrical release contained more than its fair share of nudity, but the unrated version released on DVD, entitled The Unbearably Long Self-Indulgent Director’s Cut, doubled down on the gratuitous nudity and sex, extending a scene of Dewey’s band waking up after an orgy in a crowded room of naked people, depicting Dewey reveling in even more coitus and showing Dewey picking up one of the male members of his band.

The Unbearably Long Self-Indulgent Director’s Cut crosses the line from showing abundant nudity to satirise the cliché of rock star excess in biopics to showing nudity for the sake of nudity and so finds itself as the first entry on our list.

!!!! 8. What?

Roman Polanski’s little-seen 1973 improvised comedy What? contains little else besides gratuitous sex and nudity. The film chronicles the Alice in Wonderland-like journey of a young American girl, Nancy, who takes shelter in an Italian villa after escaping from a would-be rapist. The inhabitants of the villa are wacky, sex-crazed characters who menace and taunt Nancy during her stay.

Nancy spends the majority of the feature topless, or, in various states of undress. Among the many sexual mishaps she must endure, one of the most galling occurs when she awakes to find a strange man performing cunnilingus on her in her sleep, at which point he angrily demands what she thinks she’s doing in the villa.

This odd, and extremely sexist film, will literally cause you to say “What?” during most of the run time. Polanski’s only apparent motivation in making this slapdash feature was to have an excuse to film star Sydne Rome naked.

What? remains an aberration in Polanski’s filmography, wedged in-between his adaptation of Macbeth and his masterpiece Chinatown, and is of interest only to Polanski completists or film buffs interested in abundant nudity.

!!!! 7. The Master

Paul Thomas Anderson confused audiences and critics alike with his follow-up to the Academy Award nominated There Will Be Blood, 2012’s The Master. The Master’s story concerns the relationship between Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a character modeled after Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, and his disciple, a degenerate drunk Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix); the duo have a tumultuous relationship, with Dodd attempting to cure Freddie of his chronic drinking and violent outbursts via his self-help system known as “The Cause”, but ultimately failing to save Freddie from himself.

The Master can be interpreted as a symbolic work, with Dodd representing the rational super-ego to Freddie’s bestial Id. Freddie is an untamable force driven by his basest desires, and Anderson does not shy away from showing Freddie acting on his impulses, from making love to a sand sculpture of a woman, to numerous sexual liaisons, to one particularly bizarre scene that earns The Master a spot on our list.

During a party one of Dodd’s disciples throws for him, Dodd leads the partygoers in a sing-along while Freddie watches from the sidelines; normally this wouldn’t be anything to write home about except that Freddie imagines all the female partygoers with their clothes off, including Dodd’s pregnant wife, played by Amy Adams.

While it could be argued that this scene is justified thematically because it illustrates Freddie’s feral nature and Dodd’s lecherous tendencies, it goes on for way, way too long, playing out in real time along with the music. Even though I consider The Master a masterpiece, I have to admit this scene crosses the line from art to exploitation.

!!!! 6. Barbarella

1968’s Barbarella opens with a famous scene of a naked Jane Fonda, who plays the titular heroine, floating through space while the credits play and instantly earns a spot on our list of films with gratuitous nudity before the ribald narrative even begins. Produced by B-movie icon Dino De Laurentiis, Barbarella adapts a bawdy French comic strip to the big screen, bringing with it all of the all the over the top smuttiness and innuendo of the source material.

In the film, the sexually vivacious Barbarella must travel to into uncharted space to apprehend the nefarious Duran Duran (the namesake of the 80’s pop group), who has his hands on a weapon that could spread untold destruction throughout the galaxy.

On her quest, Barbarella meets many different alien creatures, most of whom she has sex with, before being captured by Duran Duran and placed in the Excessive Machine, a device that kills those imprisoned within it via excessive sexual ecstasy. The courageous Barbarella’s insatiable sexual appetites prove too much for the Excessive Machine, which short-circuits when Barbarella reaches climax.

Barbarella’s plot has little else on its mind than sex, nudity and sexual innuendo. While the filmmakers intended us to take Barbarella’s exploits as farce, that doesn’t pardon the film’s gratuitous sex and nudity, which lands it at number 6 on our list.

!!!! 5. Piranha 3D

In 2010, director Alexandre Aja decided to cash in on the 3D boom that followed in the wake of Avatar with his revamping of the Joe Dante-directed 1978 cult classic Piranha. Aja utilized 3D to deliver horror fans the pulpy thrills they expect from the genre, including excessive nudity and sex scenes rendered in all 3 dimensions.

One particularly memorable scene occurs when two of the female characters engage in an extended underwater lovemaking session that lasts for minutes onscreen; this scene has no bearing on the plot, or, the development of the characters as individuals and is therefore completely gratuitous.

Despite Piranha 3D’s stomach-churning gore and superfluous nudity, critics took the film’s excesses as a tongue-in-cheek homage to the horror genre and gave the feature a favourable 73% rating on the review aggregator website Rottentomatoes.com.

Audiences also responded kindly to Piranha 3D’s over the top spectacle, making it a hit to the tune of $83 million dollars at the world-wide box office. A sequel, Piranha 3DD followed in 2012, retaining the excessive nudity but none of the wit or winking homage. Even though critics decided to look the other way, there’s no denying that Piranha 3D takes its homage to pornographic extremes and loses sight of the satire in many instances.

!!!! 4. Heavy Metal

In 1981, Ivan Reitman helped bring an animated version of the comic book Heavy Metal, known for its abundant nudity and gore, to the big screen. The movie consists of a series of fantasy and science fiction vignettes linked together by the presence of a mystical green orb known as the Loc-Nar.

The Canadian production tapped notable Canadian comedies from the sketch comedy series SCTV to help voice the feature, including Harold Ramis, Eugene Levy, and John Candy. The film version of Heavy Metal received largely dismissive reviews on its release but enjoyed a healthy box office. Despite the cool critical reception, audiences kept coming back to see the very adult cartoon and Heavy Metal developed a cult following at midnight screenings akin to the cult around The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

Heavy Metal’s continued popularity can be attributed to its willingness to throw as much animated T & A at the screen as possible. Each vignette finds ample opportunity for its animated female characters (all of whose proportions defy human physiology as we know it) to disrobe, from a mystical female warrior who must swim nude in a purifying pool before she goes into battle, to a secretary abducted from the White House and seduced by an alien robot, to a nymphomaniac queen who rules tyrannically over an alien planet.

Heavy Metal is juvenile male fantasy distilled into its purest form; no vignette represents this more so than “Den”, the tale of a nerdy teen transported by the Loc-Nar to a planet called Neverwhere where the Loc-Nar then transforms him into a well hung bodybuilder who finds himself a hit with ladies. Heavy Metal’s no holds barred approach to nudity and violence won it an enduring audience and a spot on our list.

!!!! 3. Flesh Gordon

Directors Michael Benveniste and Howard Ziehm grew up watching Universal Pictures’ Flash Gordon serials and wanted to pay tribute to the swashbuckling tales that thrilled them in their youth by creating a homage to the science fiction epic.

They did so in the most adult way imaginable. The homage/spoof of Flash Gordon, Flesh Gordon, recreated the lo-fi FX of the Flash Gordon serials in loving detail, but added a few extra helpings of nudity and sex. Flesh Gordon’s plot hews fairly close to Flash Gordon’s and concerns the heroic Flesh’s quest to save the Earth from the evil Emperor Wang’s “Sex Ray”, a device that has turned everyone on earth into nymphomaniacs.

Many of the artists that helped create Flesh Gordon would move on to greater things, including Greg Jein, the man responsible for the miniatures in Flesh Gordon, who would go on to do special effects work for Star Trek: The Next Generation and Close Encounters of The Third Kind, and also make-up artist Rick Baker, who would eventually receive an Academy Award for his work on the classic horror flick An American Werewolf in London. Even actor Craig T. Nelson makes an un-credited voice appearance as The Great God Porno.

Although clearly-talented people worked hard on Flesh Gordon to make it a loving homage to a serial that had a huge impact on their youth, it doesn’t change the fact that Flesh Gordon is nothing more than a glorified albeit hilarious skin-flick, which is probably why it had to be re-edited to receive an R-rating after the MPAA slapped its first cut with an X-rating.

!!!! 2. Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay

Audiences loved the antics of stoner duo Harold and Kumar in their first feature film Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle, so the pair decided to re-team for a cash-in sequel, 2008’s Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay.

The sequel’s bold title promised to redress the horrific human rights violations occurring at the Guantanamo Bay via the comedy stylings of two chronically stoned slackers. Instead, Harold and Kumar spend about five minutes of screen time trapped in the prison before they promptly escape, addressing none of the thorny social and moral issues around the prison and its detainees.

Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay’s exploitative elements go beyond its attention-grabbing title. One scene in particular lands the comedy firmly at number 2 on our list. After escaping from their extremely brief captivity in Guantanamo Bay, Harold and Kumar find their way to Miami, where they crash their friend Raza’s party.

It turns out that Raza has come up with his answer to topless parties: bottomless parties. In a particular egregious display of gratuitous nudity, the camera travels through the party as the pair and Raza discuss key plot points, lingering over the naked crotches of the female partygoers. For promising social commentary but delivering little more than stoner hijinks and gratuitous nudity, Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay earns runner-up on our list.

!!!! 1. Striptease

Cinephiles often cite the 1995 Paul Verhoeven-directed debacle Showgirls as a high water mark for terrible films whose primary appeal lies in the outrageous amounts of gratuitous nudity contained within them, but the very next year saw the release of another misbegotten picture that gives Showgirls a run for its money in the race for number one in camp stupidity and excessive skin-bearing: 1996’s Golden Raspberry Worst Picture winner, Striptease.

Unlike Showgirls, a film that some have gone on to defend as a satire of the American dream, nobody seems to remember or particularly care about Striptease and with good reason: not only is it stupid, it’s also boring.

Prerelease, Striptease earned notoriety because star Demi Moore underwent breast augmentation surgery before shooting started, which tells you that the film had little else but nudity going for it. The plot concerns Erin Grant’s (Moore) struggle to retain custody of her daughter while making a living as a pole dancer.

Critics found Moore’s character too dramatic for the material, especially given that the film’s supporting characters come across as cartoonish. Even worse, many critics complained that the nakedness, the main selling point of the film and the reason for it existing, failed to provide enough titillation.

Striptease earns our top spot because, aside from stripping being its main selling point, the feature failed to deliver the goods in a way that appealed to audiences, which renders the excessive nudity even more gratuitous. This failure of a film can’t even muster a cult following, like Showgirls, and seems doomed to obscurity.

Any other famous examples we missed? Keeping in mind I left out Showgirls intentionally because it shows up on these lists too often. Let us know in the comments.

15 Sexiest Horror Movies of All Time

Just like every other genre, horror has its tropes, commonly recurring themes or ideas that constantly seem to show up in every movie no matter what. The use of sex and sexuality in horror films is almost as expected as the obligatory love scene in every romantic comedy: we’re just used to it.

For the most part, we are bombarded by films that use nudity and blood as a backdrop for a poorly strung-together storyline, and in many ways, as bait that brings the audience into the theater. But that doesn’t mean horror movies can’t actually be sexy. A number of films in the horror genre managed to infuse sex into the story in a way that worked and created something that could turn audiences on while still giving them the heebie jeebies.

Crimson Peak, the latest horror film from Guillermo del Toro, will hopefully continue in this tradition, as the director promises it will be frightening as well as kinky. But what makes a horror movie, or any movie for that matter, sexy? Since it’s quite obvious that different strokes will always appeal to different folks, we complied a list of the 15 Sexiest Horror Movies of All Time, from the sexy slow burn to the downright explicit and the cerebral to the explosive.

!!!! THE HUNGER (1983)

“The timeless beauty of Catharine Deneuve… The cool elegance of David Bowie… The open sexuality of Susan Sarandon.”

The trailer pretty much says it all. The Hunger takes the blood and sex metaphor that runs through every vampire story to the highest level when beautiful vampire Miriam (Deneuve) starts looking for a new lover after her husband John (Bowie) begins to rapidly age.

The film itself, directed by a young Tony Scott, is ethereal and sexy, but the most memorable scene involves Miriam’s seduction of a doctor named Sarah (Sarandon). Though the drinking and transference of blood is still Miriam’s main goal, Scott’s film keeps sex at the forefront of the lives of its undead characters. The Hunger is clear about its portrayal of the dark eroticism that permeates this and nearly every vampire tale. No sparkling here.

!!!! BRAM STOKER’S DRACULA (1992)

Bram Stoker’s Dracula is one of the sexier adaptations of the classic vampire tale, and while it’s fairly clear that the story on its own has definite sex appeal – as can be expected from the , hedonist, aristocratic vampires of Bram Stoker – director Francis Ford Coppola played up the story with a more sensual vibe. Shots like those of Dracula’s (Gary Oldman) eyes looking in on Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves) as he rides toward his castle evoke the mystery and romance of a much older film, and of course, there are a number of well-known scenes involving hot vampire lovin’ – Harker’s encounter with Dracula’s vampire brides being number one.

While most of the sexy moments in the film are meant for the male gaze, it’s easy to also get caught up in the over-the-top romance between Mina (Winona Ryder) and Drac. And, apparently, there was just as much steaminess going on behind the scenes. On a scene where Oldman was asked to whisper seductively to Lucy (Sadie Frost) off-screen, the actress stated that his words were “very unrepeatable.”


!!!! AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (1981)

An American Werewolf in London is the story of David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne), two BFFs who, on a backpacking trip across the Yorkshire Moors, are attacked by a werewolf that kills Jack and “turns” David.

Naughton spends most of the film in various states of undress, which has its benefits, but most memorably, he shares a sexy shower and love scene with Alex (Jenny Agutter), the nurse who cared for him while he was in the hospital, to the sounds of Van Morrison. Once he does finally transform into a werewolf, a sequence that is still iconic today for its groundbreaking special effects, David wakes up the next morning feeling great, even after murdering a ton of people. So being a werewolf has its benefits too. You know, until you die.

!!!! JENNIFER’S BODY (2009)

In Jennifer’s Body, mean girl Jennifer (Megan Fox) is offered as a virgin sacrifice by an indie-rock band in exchange for fame and glory, the ritual goes wrong and turns her into a succubus who must subsist on the flesh of men to stay alive and become stronger. Her friend Needy (Amanda Seyfried) begins to discover what has happened to Jennifer and tries to stop her killing spree.

The film itself is mostly campy silliness (especially in moments like Jennifer’s assertion that she actually “goes both ways” when killing), but Megan Fox is the epitome of sex as the girl you know will kill you but you still want to get with anyway. And the movie itself does poke fun at the horror genre’s obsession with punishing promiscuous young girls, and instead turns the school “floozy” into a lean, mean killer. There’s also Jennifer and Needy’s kiss that, while many say it was thrown in for promotional purposes, writer Diablo Cody defended as a portrayal of the almost romantic type of relationship between teenage girls in serious friendships.

!!!! DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS (1971)

Daughters of Darkness is the kind of vampire movie that favors dreamy lighting and gorgeous actors over extreme horror, but Delphine Seyrig’s performance as the Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who killed virgins and bathed in their blood to stay youthful forever, provides all the sex appeal in this Belgian film.

In a particularly unforgettable scene, she wears a skin-tight silver dress as she manipulates and seduces a young couple who were traveling through Belgium while on their honeymoon. When Elizabeth decides that Valerie (Danielle Ouimet) is the lover she’s looking for, the two women eventually kill and drink the blood of Valerie’s abusive husband Stefan (John Karlen). Originally titled Les Lévres Rouges or The Red Lips, the film is a classic lesbian vampire tale that is still just as erotic and enticing today as it was in 1971.

!!!! SLEEPAWAY CAMP (1983)

Shy Angela goes to live with her cousin and eccentric aunt after a boating accident kills her father and brother. But it’s when she attends Camp Arawak and the people who tease her start turning up dead that the film really gets interesting. Sleepaway Camp is a basic 80s slasher flick set at a summer camp – or so it seems. The film promises the kind of explicit sex that other movies of this type deliver, which probably packed the theatre with more than a few fourteen-year-old boys, but it ends up turning the genre on its head somewhat by showing more guys than girls in short shorts and crop tops.

Camp is inherently exciting for most teens, especially because they’re away from their parents and unsupervised, and the movie makes this clear. There is definitely a vibe of sexiness throughout, but it is subverted at every turn, making for a ride that will have viewers nervous before too long. Be forewarned though, Sleepaway Camp’s ending is one of the creepiest in horror movie history, so better watch this one with the lights on.

!!!! INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE (1994)

Ah, Interview with the Vampire. It’s hard to deny the overt sensuality of this film, whether it comes from the hunkiest stars 1994 had to offer (Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise), the lush backgrounds of New Orleans and Paris, or the dramatic, painfully romantic dialogue. “Drink from me and live forever,” reads the tagline, and yeah, it makes the life Louis (Pitt) is always whining about actually sound pretty appealing. Bummed as they often are, vampires are always doing their best to bring sexy back.

In the standout role, Cruise’s performance as Lestat managed to surprise nearly everyone, including Anne Rice, who wrote the screenplay based on her own novel, and the character would go on to influence dozens of bratty, entitled, but downright arousing vamps in films to come. The sex appeal is there, although the movie wasn’t quite as erotic as the book – and definitely left quite a bit of the relationship between Louis and Lestat up to the imagination.

!!!! CAT PEOPLE (1982)

Say what you want about the original Cat People released in 1942, it’s easy to concede that the 1982 remake shows a lot more skin. But the nudity in director Paul Schrader’s version is only part of the reason it’s considered to be so provocative. Irena (Natassja Kinski) is a young woman who visits her brother Paul (Malcolm McDowell) in New Orleans only to find out that he is a werecat who turns into a murderous black panther after having sex – and so is she.

In both versions of the film, the theme of sexuality and how it affects a young woman is very present, but Kinski’s performance in this version may be one of the sexiest in any horror film. When she walks up the stairs undressing as she leads Oliver (John Heard) to bed, her predatory look and movements blur the lines between animal and woman even before her eventual transformation.

!!!! THIRST (2009)

The Korean film Thirst, from director Chan-wook Park (Oldboy), follows in the tradition of many other erotic stories where a priest cannot help falling in love. Unfortunately, Priest Sang-hyeon (Kang-ho Song) was also accidentally infected during a blood transfusion, causing him to become a vampire. Very soon, he can no longer fight his desire for the beautiful and married Tae-ju (Ok-bin Kim), and events transpire that lead him to commit one sin after another.

Blood and sex all create one big pleasure fest in this film for a man who has tried to avoid the sins of the flesh in his desire to help others. But while the romance between the leads is captivating, the movie doesn’t quite have the happiest of endings, which, when you think about it, you can pretty much expect.

!!!! THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK (1987)

Based on the novel by John Updike, The Witches of Eastwick stars Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer as three lonely women who unwittingly bring the Devil (Jack Nicholson) to their sleepy, New England town as they discuss their desire to meet the perfect man. One by one, Daryl Van Horne (aka The Devil, aka Jack) seduces each woman by appealing to her unique personality and feeding the development of her latent witch powers.

This scenario sees them all eventually living together in ecstasy in his giant mansion… until they begin to fear what both they and Daryl are capable of. Though the film is a bit more comedy than horror, a number of racy moments stand out – like Susan Sarandon’s sexy cello lesson – and the fact that Jack Nicholson seems to so totally satisfy each of these beautiful women manages to even make him seem pretty sexy.

!!!! ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE (2013)

Another vampire flick (yes, vampires are sexy, what’re ya gonna do), Only Lovers Left Alive focuses mostly on the minutiae of immortal life and how love just may be the only thing worth living for. Adam (Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (Tilda Swinton) share a devotion that has endured countless lifetimes, and while there are several nude scenes in which they sleep tangled in one another’s embrace, the true eroticism of the film is in their glances and their whispered words to one another.

Director Jim Jarmusch (Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai and Stranger Than Paradise) uses understated sensuality to hint at the depth of the relationship between the two leads, as well as the relationship between vampires and blood. In addition, these are the kind of vampires who actually make being one look cool again, and it’s hard not to appreciate this fact. Though it may not be the most original horror movie involving the undead, it’s definitely appealing and totally sexy.

!!!! PIRANHA 3D (2010)

When you’re looking for a movie that’ll serve up sex and gore with equal frequency and fun, Piranha 3D should be right up your alley. A remake of the cheesy 1978 film Piranha, the 2010 version revolves around a group of locals and tourists trying to escape the flesh-eating, prehistoric fish that suddenly begin swarming Lake Victoria during spring break.

The movie includes a number of sexy actors (Kelly Brook, Elizabeth Shue, and… Adam Scott?) as well as body shots, porn stars, bikini dance parties, skinny-dipping, and an epic we’re-probably-going-to-die-so-let’s-just-go-for-it kiss. Piranha 3D received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it’s hard not to enjoy this film for being exactly what it was meant to be, as well as considerably funnier and sexier than most horror movies about totally unlikely natural events that end in the maiming of a lot of hot people.

!!!! SPECIES (1995)

In 1993, a transmission is picked up by the SETI program, detailing how alien DNA can be spliced with human DNA. Clearly ill-advised, this does not stop the scientists from immediately doing it, and the result is Sil (Natasha Henstridge), a young girl who rapidly ages into a beautiful twentysomething woman with only one thing on her mind. As she has the innate desire to procreate, Sil has sex with and/or murders pretty much everyone in her way and transforms from her gorgeous model body into a warrior alien, designed by H.R. Giger, whenever necessary. The movie still has a definite cult following, despite mostly underwhelming reviews at the time of its release, and it eventually spawned three sequels, pun intended. Most of its success is largely due to the fact that the original film centers around people getting killed by a ruthless, beautiful woman, which if you’re ever interested in checking the YouTube comments, is apparently the way a lot of viewers want to go.

!!!! DON’T LOOK NOW (1973)

No sexy horror movie list would be complete without this disquieting thriller starring Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. The two play a married couple who, after the death of their daughter, take a trip to Venice and encounter a clairvoyant who says she has a message for them from the beyond.

The film is more of a frank depiction of grief than anything else, but a particular scene in which the couple are seen making love is so explicit and erotic that it caused audiences to wonder if the actors were doing it “for real.” As the film has come to be celebrated for its artistic merit, the scene itself can also be appreciated for being sexy, not exploitative, when most horror movies can’t seem to figure out the difference.

!!!! THE CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012)

Co-written and directed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer alum Drew Goddard, The Cabin in the Woods has its arousing moments: a girl (Anna Hutchinson) dancing provocatively in front of the fireplace, the same girl flashing her breasts in a dark forest… But as a result of the meta-storyline the film has become famous for, it also delves into the reasons why sex and horror go together, why we actually have to see Hutchinson naked, and why the virgin always dies last, if at all.

Its sexy moments are just as awkward and creepy as they are erotic (that weird kissing scene with the wolf’s head?), and the film impresses in its ability to elicit all three reactions during every sexy moment. The Cabin in the Woods subverts the genre even as it embraces it, making the sex scenes cerebral while still being stimulating. And if that’s not your cup of tea, it also has Chris Hemsworth biting Hutchinson’s panties, which is hot in any universe.

!!!! HONORABLE MENTION: FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (1996)

The first film in the From Dusk Till Dawn makes our list for one reason only, and her name is Salma Hayek. Though George Clooney in his prime (and with a badass neck tattoo) definitely isn’t bad to look at, Hayek portrays the beautiful dancer Santánico Pandemónium in the film, who puts on a show most moviegoers still haven’t forgotten.

In a Mexican bar, Hayek dances provocatively with a snake and leans down to lick beer off her leg to “After Dark” by Tito & Tarantula. Eventually, though, she transforms into a horrific vampire with reptilian features whom Seth (Clooney) kills after she vows to make him her slave. All in all, the movie itself may not be the sexiest horror flick out there, but the scene certainly deserves a mention.

That about does it for our list of truly erotic scare flicks. Undoubtedly, there are a number of other horror films out there that someone may have found sexy, so if we forgot your favorite, please let us know in the comments.
