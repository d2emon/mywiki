!! I Hate People

God I wish that I could hide away 
And find a wall to bang my brains 
I'm living in a fantasy, a nightmare dream..reality 
People ride about all day 
In metal boxes made away 
I wish that they would drop the bomb 
And kill these cunts that don't belong 

I hate people..I hate the human race 
I hate peopleI hate your ugly face 
I hate peopleI hate your fucking mess 
I hate peopleand they hate me 

My mother thinks that I am a jerk 
Because I hate my bleeding work 
Be like your daddy he's sincere 
But don't be true ..or you'll be queer 
I'm working at my 9 to 5 
with boring cunts that give me jibe 
their talking of the love they give 
they never givethey never give 

I hate people.I hate the human race 
I hate peopleI hate your ugly face 
I hate peopleI hate the mess 
I hate people..and they hate me
