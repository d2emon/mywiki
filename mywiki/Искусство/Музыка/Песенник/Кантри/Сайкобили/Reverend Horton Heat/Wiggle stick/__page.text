I got a wiggle stick, momma
And you'll like it a lot
I got a wiggle stick, momma
And you'll like it a lot
When I start to shake baby what I got
You start to shake it with me honey
Things get hot

I got a whammy bar, momma
And it's just your size
I got a whammy bar, momma
And it's just your size
When your knees start to sqeeze
And you open your eyes
My whammy bar shakes and it satisfies

I got a viberator nob
Let me flick your switch
I got a viberator nob
Let me flick your switch
When your knees start to sqeeze
And your lip starts to twitch
My viberator nob's gonna' scratch that itch
(Yeah scratch it baby!
Scratch it
Scratch it
Yeah!)

I got a wiggle stick, momma
A wiggle stick, momma
I got a wiggle stick, momma
I got a wiggle stick, momma
When I start to shake baby what I got
You start to shake it with me honey
Things get hot
