!! 7. Databases
Databases are where all your data is stored. It’s like a bunch of filing cabinets with folders filled with files. Databases come mainly in two flavors: SQL and NoSQL. SQL provides more structure which helps with making sure all the data is correct and validated. NoSQL provides a lot of flexibility for building and maintaining applications.

* MongoDB - is an open-sourced NoSQL database and is currently the only database supported by Meteor.
* Redis - is the most popular key-value store. It is lighting fast for retrieving data but doesn’t allow for much depth in the data storage.
* PostgreSQL - is a popular open-sourced SQL database.
* MySQL - is another popular open-sourced SQL database. MySQL is used in Wordpress websites.
* Oracle - is an enterprise SQL database.
* SQL Server - is an SQL server manager created by Microsoft.
