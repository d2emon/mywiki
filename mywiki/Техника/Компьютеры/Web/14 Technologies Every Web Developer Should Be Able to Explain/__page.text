!! 14 Technologies Every Web Developer Should Be Able to Explain

I often find myself thinking of new and simple ways to explain some pretty complicated web development concepts to our clients. What I have found is that the concepts aren’t hard to grasp, but rather all the other terminology is really hard to keep straight. This is my attempt to explain some common terminology in today’s modern web world (as of January 2015) and my hope is that you can find it helpful too.

Thanks for reading and I hope you found something in here that gave you a new way to think about or talk about web technologies. This was not meant to be an all-encompassing list, but rather a way to talk about all the great technologies we have at our finger tips.

And next week, we will tackle this mess (not really, my fingers hurt)
