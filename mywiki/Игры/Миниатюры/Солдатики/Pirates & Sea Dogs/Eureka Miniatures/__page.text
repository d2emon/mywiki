!! Eureka Miniatures

An excellent range from down under (Australia). Like the Foundry, they have a rather extensive line of pirates. The 'regular' pirates are reminiscent of the Howard Pyle pirates. Aside from some excellent character figures and general combat poses, many of the figures are engaged in some on-ship activity, pulling ropes, carrying barrels or loading cannons.

Since there's no reason the guys should have all the fun, Eureka also has several female pirates. These are of the more sexy type, as opposed to say, Old Glory's. The picture was supplied by Sgt. fatgoblin.

For those with more exotic taste, there are also some excellent multi-purpose Chinese pirates, as well as Turkish pirates (picture taken from Chronofus' site) for more of an Arabian Nights setting (Sinbad, anyone?).

Finally, Eureka also delivers for the more fantastically oriented frother, with some excellent skeletal pirates and a few zombie pirates you can see here in our excellent "All Things Rotten" Zombie Showcase (nr. 27).

Only thing missing is an actual pirate ship. No wait, they've got that too. The Eureka ship is different from other ranges, in that it's more a set of platforms or shipdecks than an actual ship (see picture). However this allows to enlarge your ship by adding mid-sections to it. Furthermore Eureka also produces a variety of deck junk, for use with your pirate ship.
