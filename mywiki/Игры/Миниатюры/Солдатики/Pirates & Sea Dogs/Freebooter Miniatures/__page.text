!! Freebooter Miniatures

The German company of that other WK, the famous sculptor Werner Klocke (sometimes referred to as the Werner Klocke). Although mainly a fantasy range, Freebooter has a few interesting twists on the piracy subject, with a limited edition pirate girl (250 copies), an amusing limited edition (again) pirate goblin (only a few left!) and a very nice (and unlimited edition) flying pirate boat. A Blackbeard figure has just been added.
