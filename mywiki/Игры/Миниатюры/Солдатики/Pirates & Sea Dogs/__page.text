!! Pirates & Sea Dogs

!!!! Alternative Pirate Miniatures

''Selected by the White Knight''

Ahoi there mateys, grab a mug of grog and sit down to listen to me tales of mayhem, blood, wenches and lots of pieces o' eight...

This showcase is dedicated to exploring the theme of piracy from a miniatures point of view. We all remember those old swashbuckling movies we used to watch as kids, starring bigger than life heros as Errol Flynn (Captain Blood, The Seahawk), Burt Lancaster (The Crimson Pirate) and other roguish men in tights. Never mind that real life pirates were the worst scum of the sea, murderous and thieving lowlifes, dreaming of rape, pillage and plunder. No, in our minds they're a happy, singing bunch who steal from the rich, not to give to the poor, no, not even to better themselves, but to go bury those hard earned treasures on some lost and unknown island in a spot marked with an X, never to return until some lucky fellow happens to find a map indicating it's location. This map would preferrably be tattood on some dying old pirate's back as that proved more durable after early fiasco's with maps drawn on crackers and left with the Captain's trusty parrot Polly for safekeeping.

And to humour the ship's surgeon Doc, I'm not even going to mention rebasing any of them. For more background on pirates and their time and a set of free rules, you can check out these excellent articles on Chronofus' Australian Wargames site. There's even a section on building your own ships. Another interesting site was recommended by Sgt. fatgoblin and compares the sizes of pirate minis from various manufacturers. It has many pictures of pirate miniatures. But now on to the schowcase.

Avast, ye scurvy dogs, or you'll walk the plank...
