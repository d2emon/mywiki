!! Flagship games

FG produces the popular "Pirates!" rules for 25mm naval battles with ships and miniatures (third edition already). They sell a wide range of ships, both historical and fantastical to go with it, but unlike some who shall not be named, they have no problem with you using other manufacturers' products. All ships in the line are 25/28mm and resin cast and include galleons, gunships, sloops, shipwrecks, rowboats etc...

They also make seamonsters for those more fantastically themed battles.
