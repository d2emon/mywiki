!!  Armalion / DSA

Fanpro produces these german games set in the world of the Dark Eye. Some are very good, others are somewhat lacking. Most look better in person than in the pictures...

The DSA range has a few suitable figures in the Personalities lines: El Harkir (the renowned pirate, 16020) and the Imperial Grand Admiral Rateral Sanin (16021, not really a pirate but can be painted as). Strangely enough the 'Creatures' section holds another pirate figure, described as 'Follower of Charyptoroth' (17056).

The Armalion (tabletop) line has three more blisters of pirates, including 2 leaders (male and female), 3 fearsome female pirates and 3 male (more exotic) pirates.
