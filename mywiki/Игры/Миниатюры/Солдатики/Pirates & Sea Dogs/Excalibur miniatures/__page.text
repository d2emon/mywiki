!! Excalibur miniatures

This German company makes sf-miniatures for the "Fearless" game, and generic fantasy miniatures. The fantasy range includes two interesting pirate figures in the "Adventurers & Warriors" subsection. The Red Borgil is definitely a pirate captain, with the mandatory peg leg. The other one, Drake, is a more modest character, although the pose, with one foot resting on what appears to be a treasure chest and the pet parrot will certainly draw some attention to him. Both models appear very well sculpted and come with plastic bases.
