!! Miniature World Maker

Australian terrain maker, specialising in durable rubber scenery. Their catalog includes a 25mm pirate ship, but while they have some nice scenery, the ship seems a bit poor in my opinion. You can see some of their buildings in the excellent [[Gothic & Fantasy Buildings Showcase -> http://www.marbles.frothersunite.com/tgoth1.html]].
