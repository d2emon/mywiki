!! Reaper

If you're a regular visitor of these showcases, you'll know Reaper, that manufacturer of most excellent fantasy miniatures. Well, they have pirates too, two kinds even. They produced a boxed set with some fine pirate characters (live ones) and they have undead pirates in both the "Dark Heaven" and "Warlord" line .

The boxed set is called "Pirates of the Dragonspine Sea" and holds six of the saltiest dogs that ever sailed said sea. Other human pirates, like Eric Swiftblade (2144), can be found in the Dark Heaven line with some browsing...

Now just take a look at Razig, the undead pirate from the "Warlord line". This guy has a roguish charm even in death. Could be the outfit, could be the hair, could be the sinister parrot, but I can only wish I'd look this good dead (preferrably much, much later. Much.). This figure is not to be confused with Kazig, the undead pirate, an equally useful model from the "Dark Heaven" line.

Last but not least is a recent addition to the "Warlord" range in the lovely skeletal pirate crew (4 figures). A cannon and crew is also available.
