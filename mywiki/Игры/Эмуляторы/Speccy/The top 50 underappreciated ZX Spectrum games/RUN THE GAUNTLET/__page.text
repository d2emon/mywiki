!! RUN THE GAUNTLET

Based on the television show of the same name, Run The Gauntlet's laborious loading system may have made it all a bit unbearable at times, but fortunately, it proved to be worth the wait. Not every individual event gelled. The driving and boating elements were great fun, but The Hill proved to be a real shit. It's not quite on the same difficult level as the infamous Airwolf Spectrum game, but it's not far off. Still, there was always enough in Run The Gauntlet to make it worth digging the tape out.
