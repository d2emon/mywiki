!! DAN DARE 3

%thumb%Attach:34-dandare3.jpg%%

Virgin put out a trio of Dan Dare games, and the first one is rightly regarded as something of a classic. The second, less so. Dan Dare 3, meanwhile, was terrific fun, boasting bold graphics, and more than a little tip of the hat to R-Type. Beautifully garish, with the Mekon the perfect villain for a Speccy title, Dan Dare 3 is the kind of game that the Spectrum wasn't really supposed to be able to do. It didn't start off life as a Dan Dare sequel, which probably helped. Turned out to be a really good one, though.
