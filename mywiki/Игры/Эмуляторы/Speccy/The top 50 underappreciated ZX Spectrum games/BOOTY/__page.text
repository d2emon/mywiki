!! BOOTY

The first budget game I, and many of us, ever bought for the Spectrum. Published on British Telecom's Firebird label, Booty was a rough around the edges, pirate-centric platform game, that I hold a special affection for seeing as it was the only game I could afford at the time I got it. It wasn't massive, with just 20 screens to venture through, and there's not much originality to the idea of picking up lots of treasure. It snuck up on you though, and while it was always easy to pick holes in, Booty consistently entertained. It boasted some of the finest colour clash to be seen on Sir Clive's old baby, too.
