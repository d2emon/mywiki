!! CHUCKIE EGG 2

The original Chuckie Egg is rightly regarded as a classic of 8-bit computing. Broadening out the scale of the game for Chuckie Egg 2, away from a single screen format, did pay dividends though. It's not as strong as the first game, and indeed, reviews at the time were really quite sniffy (it didn't help that a previous attempt to mount a sequel was abandoned when programmer Nigel Alderton left the publisher), but it deserves more credit than it got. Sure, the frantic nature of the original might be gone, but there's still an expansive and challenging platform game to be enjoyed.
