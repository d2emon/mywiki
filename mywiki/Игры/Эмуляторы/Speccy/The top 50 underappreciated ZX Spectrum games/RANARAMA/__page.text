The glut of Gauntlet clones that emerged in the mid-80s gave the Spectrum some terrific games. Into The Eagle's Nest and Dandy are both strong, but it was Graftgold's Ranarama that was the best of the lot. It lacked multiplayer, but there was just a little more to it than its rivals. Set across an assortment of dungeons, and with the challenge just a little more involving, it naturally went on to sell less than most of the titles it was up against. Bah.
