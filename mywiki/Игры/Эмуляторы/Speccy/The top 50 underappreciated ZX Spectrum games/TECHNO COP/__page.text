!! TECHNO COP

Can't afford the RoboCop licence? No bother. A quick flick through the thesaurus, and you have the generally disliked Techno Cop. The gimmick here was that there were two elements to the game - the driving, and the bit where you got out of the car to dispense justice. The racing part was arguably the best, but in spite of the middling to decent reviews the game attracted, it never seemed to have too many fans, and paled in comparison to Ocean's excellent RoboCop game. That said, Techno Cop was never short of ambition, and while it's not held up well, inevitably, it's a good way to do what was effectively a bit of a knock-off.
