!! TRAILBLAZER

I never got on with Marble Madness and Gyroscope on the Spectrum in the way that I think I was supposed to. For guiding a ball around, I instead went for Gremlin's Trailblazer (the Spectrum never had a decent version of Bounder, after all). Basically, you guide your ball along a road that's constantly coming towards you. And that's when the assorted obstacles and different tiles with different effects kicks in. Hair would frequently be pulled out when the bastard ball kept falling off the edge though. I've never forgiven Trailblazer for that.
