!! WW2 GI

%thumb%Attach:ww2.jpg%%

WW2 GI is the invasion of Normandy. The paranoia. The fear. The intensity that was D-Day. You will Experience it all first hand.

WW2 GI places you on Ohama Beach on D-Day, June 6 1944. You are Sergent Marty Gerardi, 101st Airborne. You have the dubious distinction of being the only para-trooper to actually storm the beaches of Normandy. Your transport plane was shot down over the English Channel. You've been rescued by a landing craft of the 1st Army Division. To return the favor, you're going to help them take the beachhead. Your goal is to get back to your company that is somewhere in the French countryside... but that won't be easy...
