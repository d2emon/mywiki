!! Howard the Duck

Activision
Alternative Software re-issue

It's all starting to make sense ... Your best friend's gone to Volcano Island ... The Dark Overlord! That's it! The Dark Overlord has kidnapped Beverly and Phil and brought them to this volcanic island. 'Cause he's hooked on thermal energy - needs to tap into it constantly to maintain his power. You know that he knows that you're the only one who can foil his plans to take over the Earth. But he thinks he can turn you into duck soup - to make the world his oyster. What he doesn't know is that you're a Quack Fu Master, an avid ultralight flyer, and a whiz with a Neutron Disintegrator. So take him up on his challenge and show the Dark Overlord that his treacherous plan isn't all it's quacked up to be.

Select a difficulty level. Push the joystick forward and back to select one of the four difficulty levels. Each level gets a little harder - see "Now What?" - then press the joystick button to start the game.

!!! ISLAND FEVER

!!!! NEGOTIATING MUTANT SLIME
To jump over the mutant slime, Howard needs a running start of three to five steps. So scamper toward the mutant slime to get up some speed, then press the joystick button when you reach the edge of it.

!!!! SNATCH THAT BACKPACK
The backpack contains;
* a solar-powered jet pack
* the Ultralight flyer
* a portable Neutron Disintegrator

!!!! CROSSING THE CHANNEL
With your solar-powered jet pack, you can cross the channel to the other sections of the island. To use the jetpack, when you get to the bank of the channel, press and release the joystick button repeatedly to open up the throttle on the jet-pack. If you press too fast, you'll kill the throttle; too slowly, and you'll lose thrust.

!!!! MUTILATING THE MUTANTS
The best way to deal with the mutants is with the old Quack-Fu techniques. You know - punching, kicking and the like.

!!!! KICKING
To kick, hold the joystick button down, then move the joystick in the direction you want to kick.

!!!! PUNCHING
To punch, move the joystick in the direction you want to punch and press the button.

!!!! STOMPING ON MOUNDS
To stomp on a mound, position Howard on top of the mound, then press the joystick button.

!!!! CROSS THE BRIDGE
Although it looks easy enough to cross,	don~t get too quacky. Them are rock-throwing mutants on the other side. They happen to have very accurate aim, and they won't stop throwing rocks until you're completely across the bridge. To dodge the rocks, try to stay to the far right or left side of the bridge.

If you're playing ADVANCED or EXPERT, you'll be given an Ultralight flyer and you must try to make it to the top of the volcano.

!!!! FLYING THE ULTRALIGHT
Pull back on the joystick to climb, push it forward to dive, and right and left to bank and turn.

!!! INSIDE THE VOLCANO

!!!! STALACTITES AND HOLES
You must dodge the falling stalactites. To manoeuvre between the holes, keep Howard's left foot on the ledge.

!!!! ENERGY BOLTS
To avoid energy bolts, move Howard up or down, depending on the position of the energy bolts.

Once you get all the way to the right side of the volcanic cavern, you'll be in a perfect position to put the Dark Overlord out of commission. Face Howard directly to the right, pull out the old Neutron Disintegrator and fire.

To fire at the Dark Overlord, simultaneously press the joystick button and move the joystick to the right. 

After each shot the Dark Overlord will change colour, and after the third shot, he'll disappear.

To shut down the volcano, walk Howard underneath the lever and, by pressing the joystick button, have Howard jump up and pull down on the lever.
