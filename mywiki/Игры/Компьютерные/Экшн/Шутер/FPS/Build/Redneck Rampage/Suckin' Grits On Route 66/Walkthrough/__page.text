!!!!!! Some more Tips By Peter Engel
When you're in the room with the last key, there's a way out of the room other than pushing the button and exiting the way you came in. In short, in the corner of that room there are some powder kegs which can be blown up to blow open a hole in the wall with some goodies behind the hole. At that point you can drop into the water tunnel that takes you back to the courtyard entrance to the pet coffin factory. Also on the Dino Cave walkthrough, there's another way to the coffin factory other than exiting the way you came from the second key; from the 2nd key, you've got to follow the passageway to the ladder down, blow open the wall by shooting the powder kegs, climb up the ladder at the far end of the crematorium, then follow the tunnel to the switch which opens up to the coffin factory courtyard.
<]

Start off in parking lot. make the first left, and go around to the other side of the house. Jump over bench and wall for a secret. Come back out to where you started, and go around wall untill you come to where their is a lot of lumber and a chain hanging down. On the end of the chain is the first key. Stand on lumber and jump over brick fence for a secret.

Go back the way you came,and go to the dino cave Go through revolving doors, and open metal door to left. Then make a left, and go in bathroom on right. Open second stall door and break vent and crawl through for secret. Open door and go in cave.

Stick to the left untill you come to a wooden beam with a switch. Flip the switch and jump over edge. Go underwater, swim through passage, and come up go in door. Make a right then left, flip switch and wait for the floor to come over to you. Go across the floor, go left and then make another left and flip the switch on the wall to open the door. Go in and get the second key.

Now go back out the same way you came in but when you come up from under water, go in the passage the way the dinosaurs is pointing. Come out of the dino cave and go back to where you got the first key and to your left is another yard to go in, go up the stairs and go over to the window and shoot the glass and jump over.

Once inside go the next room and open the door and make a right and go down the hall until you come to the vent and break it and crawl in and when you come out get out of that room and straight across is another room blocked by a curtain. Just walk through and follow the passage until you come to the room with the chain hanging down.

Flip the switch on the wall, then jump up to get the chain, climb up and hit the red button. Be quick because this lowers the saw. At the end of the tunnel you jump in and the third key is in that room.

Then push the button behind the metal box so the saw will lower for a few seconds and run across, come back out and go to the place where you saw the counter and jump over the counter, go through the double doors and Bubba is outside.

!!!! Hoover Dam
!!!!! 1 Secret
!!!!! By Bob McCusker
Start off at lift, follow walkway down and around to the left go to the end. Go to the back of the building on your left. Go up the ladder to roof, shoot grate, jump in (I'd throw a couple sticks of dyno-mite down first). When you hit bottom your on a large pipe go to the end of it and go up the ladder there. When you reach the top move to your left go underneath a pipe (notice an entrance on your right side) go around the first corner and climb the ladder to a control room. Push the switch there (notice a door opens across from you, that's where your going to next) go back down the ladder and go to the pipe you went underneath and go in the entrance there. Follow it to the ladder in the pool and climb it to the opened door above. Follow the hall to the end go past the lift to the back wall shoot the grate on the floor and jump in. Push switch at the end and backtrack to the lift and enter. Activate lift and exit. Follow the walkway around and down the stairs to where the first key is on the floor. There is a switch there also, push it and go in the lift at the end of the hall. When you exit the lift your at the door that was opened by the control room, but now the water level has risen in the pool and you have to get back to the control room. Jump in the pool, submerge and find the opening in the wall where you came in the first time and follow it out to the end. Find the ladder that you used to get to the control room before and emerge in the hallway. Go to the lift in the control room and make it to the outside.

Cross the river to the other side and go to the rear of the building and climb the ladder (just like before) shoot the grate and jump in. The pool you land in fills with water. When its high enough jump out onto the ledge and climb the ladder. Notice there is a door in front of you (locked) and one down a short tunnel (also locked) when you get to the top. Follow walkway around to the right and then to the left into another control room with a switch. Push switch go back towards the ladder the door down the tunnel opened. Enter tunnel jump down to the pool below. When you land at the bottom you can see the second key through the striped bars on the ledge. Follow the waterway around to the big tunnel enter tunnel and emerge in a big room with three ladders and a center room in the pool. Climb the ladders and push the buttons to open the center room in the pool. Jump across to the center room and push the switch there to open the striped bars where the key is. Grab key and go through opening and climb the ladder. The other door is unlocked now so go through.

About half way down the short hall there is a secret door in the wall open for the only secret in the level.

At the end of hall there is a U shaped room with a raised center platform. Push the switch on the right side and climb the ladder on the left side. Shoot the grate at the top and follow the duct work to the end find the opening and emerge on the outside. Jump up on ledge and go to the other side to the opening in the stonewall. Go up the lift to the sheriffs office. Bubba is in the jail cell to the right and the button is behind the desk. That's it... you made it. 

!!!! Alien Crash Site And Oddity Museum
!!!!! By Bob McCusker
1 Secret

Well here goes, hold on to your butt. Start at your pickup and head down the road to the intersection. Turn left and go down to the museum on your right. Enter the door and go to the left. Follow the hallway around to the end. You'll end up at the INAX 2D theater entrance. Now look to your left side of the theater sign you'll see a blue curtain that is a door but you can't enter yet. Over on the far wall there is a picture of a baby and across from that you'll see five symbols. The second one from the right side is a switch to open the curtain. Activate it and enter the theater. The key is down in front of the screen go and get it and exit the theater. Go back to where you entered the Museum and open the other door. Head down the path.

When you get to the stairs go down the first flight and stop on the landing. Look straight ahead there is a trap door in the wall, open it for the only secret area in this mission.

Continue down the stairs and jump over the wall and head towards the alien spaceship. After you dispatch the vixens scoop up all the ammo and health you can hold and go underneath the spaceship and you'll get transported into it.

Now here is a little complex part, if your not careful you fall into an abyss (if I were you I'd save my game here and possibly turn the map on). I'll try to explain this the best I can. When you appear in the spaceship your on a large platform and two vixens are across from you. After you send them to vixen hell jump over to where they were. Now this is kinda like hopscotch, the platform that your on is U shaped. Go the right side and go to the end. Another platform will light up when you get close enough. (it is shaped like a T) Jump over to it. Now head to the end of the platform and another platform will light up (a small square one) and a large platform with cryogenic tanks will appear. Jump over to them and find the entrance to a maze. Enter and turn right, then left, then right, then left, then left again, then you will be in a long hallway. Kill the vixen and continue down the hallway and you'll get transported to the final showdown. Just break the glass to the cryogenic tank your in, go kill the vixens and the super vixen and that's it, Its over. For now... :-)
