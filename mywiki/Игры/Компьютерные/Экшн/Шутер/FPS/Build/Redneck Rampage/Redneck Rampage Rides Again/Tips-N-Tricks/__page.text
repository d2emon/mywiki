!! Tips-N-Tricks

!!! Jack-O-Lope farm tip from Billy
instead of wasting all your ammo I found that using your rake will take care of the jack-o-lopes easily because you will need your ammo in the next two levels because there is not many weapons planted.

!!! Slot machine tip from Eric
You can play the one-armed bandits and, if you are persistent enough, you will actually win stuff--I won a goo-goo cluster after about 20 spins!!!! Hit the space bar to do this.

!!! Another Jack-O-lope farm tip from Billy
: When you flip the switch with the third key, and the doors opens to the deffining sound of the Jack-o-lope's. Through dynomaite over the gates and kill as many of those little bastards as you can before opening the gates.

!!! A cactus tip from Billy
For Waco, Discgraceland, and any other place with a orange cactus. If you need health and your near an orange cactus. Run over it and you will recieve 100 health, but objects will turn blue for a few seconds. It goes away be patient.

!!! A couple of neat tricks from Bobby Archambault
Anytime you incounter a toilet, (I know you already know this funny trick) get on top of it, kneel, and hit your spacebar. Sounds like Leonard is dropping a few friends off at the pool.

If you drink enought beer or whiskey, you'll get drunk, but if you're still drinking it, you'll hear good ol' Leonard up chucking. Try this one, this one's as funny as hell.

!!! A neat picture trick from Hill Billy
AREA 69: Shoot a picture above one of the desks. (It turns into the devil)(I found this works with other pictures in the game too. --Jon)
