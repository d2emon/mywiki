!! Satanic President

# Go to that room in level other than "Homeward Bound"
# Get past the gate that opens and then closes automatically once you pull the swich in that room. It's after you kill the bikers in the rooms.
# Go in that room where you have to kill the fat guy, then get the skeleton key.
# In one room you use that skeleton key that you just got
# Go in, kill the two bald old coots in hawaiian shirts
# Shoot the picture of Ronald Reagan, make sure you shot it the right way, and then you then you should see the Satanic President.
