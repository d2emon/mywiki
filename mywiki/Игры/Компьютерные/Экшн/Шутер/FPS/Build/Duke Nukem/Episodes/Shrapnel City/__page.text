!! Shrapnel City

Shrapnel City is the third episode of Duke Nukem 3D. Duke arrives back on Earth and ventures through several unrelated locations, including a bank, a movie set, a subway and a hotel, before ending up in a football stadium opposing the Cycloid Emperor.

!!! Raw Meat

A Japanese restaurant. The women in here seem to want to entertain you! Oh yes, and don't forget: "Booooorn to be Wiiiiiiild". The Pig Cops do not approve!

!!! Bank Roll

A bank. Assault Commanders are abundant here. How the heck did they get in the vault? A Mini Battlelord can be present in the vault on certain difficulties. Tough puzzle to get in the vault though.

!!! Flood Zone

Things get pretty damp in here. Someone's water mane broke loose alright. Lots of underwater areas. Not much here folks.

Don't go on top of the buildings! Unless you want to fight Mini Battlelords and Commanders!

!!! L.A. Rumble

It's rumblin' time! This was 3D Realms jab against Id Software. The building that gets demolished by the earthquake is identical to the Id Headquarters in Texas, and as it happens, Duke says "I ain't afraid of no Quake!" referring to the upcoming release of Quake. Interesting teleporter in an armoire leads to the exit (and a helicopter).

!!! Movie Set

Check out what they're filming. One set has Lunar Apocalypse (the 2nd episode), another set is filming the moon landing (a reference to the moon landing conspiracy), and there's a friendly little battlelord outside to greet you when all is said and done. The entrance to Tier Drops is inside the USA spaceship.

This level is very short compared to how far it is in the game and to the level prevoiusly.

!!! Tier Drops (secret level)

Large drops await the unwary traveller. It's like a series of different movie sets that the aliens have invaded. The "city" area with the alien babe can spawn multiple enemies, up to the mini Battlelord. The moon area has just troopers and captains, the canyon area has Octabrains, and the green alien area has a solitary mini Battlelord in the exit chamber. Enjoy!

!!! Rabid Transit

What an awesome map. Always loved the subways. Nothing too special though.

Compared to its sister (Metro Mayhem) in Duke It Out In D.C., this mission is very small and wont take too much of your time. Quite a tricky fight through the blue key card door though.

!!! Fahrenheit

Turning up the heat. Includes a fire station, the area of town that doesn't like O.J. Simpson, and a radio station playing the breast, errr best tunes in town.

!!! Hotel Hell

Worst. Vacation. Ever. A Mini Battlelord has been called to check you in and a hot Mini Battlelord....errr babe is waiting for you by the pool! Indiana Jones has also stayed at this hotel, and the exit to Freeway is nearby.

Play it! One of the most popular Duke Nukem 3D levels ever.

!!! Freeway (secret level)

Duke's way or the freeway. I didn't know Duke was secretly Sarah Connor!

!!! Stadium

Game over! The final showdown!
