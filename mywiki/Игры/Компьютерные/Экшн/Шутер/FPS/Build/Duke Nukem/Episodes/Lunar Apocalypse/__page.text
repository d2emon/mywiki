!! Lunar Apocalypse

Lunar Apocalypse is the second episode of Duke Nukem 3D. This episode is set in space, both in space stations and on the Moon. Duke explores a number of spacecraft and space stations, before landing on the Moon to explore there as well. After forcing his way through some lunar facilities, he ends up facing off against the Overlord.

!!! Spaceport

You get to a spaceport with beautiful window views of stars and Earth, Moon and the Sun.

Here you first get the Shrink Ray and the Devastator.

You have to solve a combination of switches to unlock the shield shaft.

Collect the keycards and get to the escape pod.

Overall a relatively tame level as the first level in the second episode should be. It is also worth mentioning that hanging around the windows for too long will result in taking damage from from the passing alien ships.

!!! Incubator

It's an incubator. Pretty cool level. The aliens sure picked a nice place to hatch their young, but Duke will have none of that. Not too difficult, hit one switch, get one key, kill a whole bunch of slimers, and most importantly, get the Freezethrower.

!!! Warp Factor

Is the starship Enterprise. A Mini Battlelord appears here. MUCH easier than his big brother. Duke has some great quotes here. "Ah, the captain's log!" This level also contains a ridiculous amount of Sentry Drones; most of which are hiding behind a door or in a tunnel, giving you little time to react.

!!! Fusion Station

A fusion station. It's not really clear whether this level is of human or alien origin. It decorated with a lot of alien structures, but the name "fusion station" suggests it's a nuclear fusion plant. It's a pretty eerie level for the first time player. A very linear level that directs you to the exit from start to finish. Pretty intense encounter with the fatties at the end though.

This level is definitely a unique one. The entire level is one huge structure and if you're packing any jet pack fuel, you can literally fly right to the top floor.

!!! Occupied Territory

The hardest level in episode 2, enemy wise. The name implies this was a human space station that just got completely ravaged by aliens. This level is troublesome after you open those first big doors. First you get enforcers, then a TON of sentry drones, then more enforcers. Once you get the first key, you get the pleasure of fighting one (sometimes two) Mini Battlelords just for another stinking keycard. Once you open the central room, you can either shoot the switch on the wall to get to Spin Cycle, the secret level, or hit the regular switch and have the pleasure of fighting ANOTHER two Mini Battlelords to get to Tiberius Station.

As its name suggests, this level is filled to the brim with aliens. Enforcers and Octabrains? Those guys are wimps. Remember that Mini Battlelord at the end of Warp Factor? Well there's 5 of them in this mission, none of which go out of their way to be friendly. You'll definitely want to hang onto that RPG and Devastator ammo, but there is a nice pipebomb alternative as well.

!!! Spin Cycle (secret level)

The good old washing machine level. It's the first secret level, and can be accessed through Occupied Territory. Another simple level with tons of enemies. Just keep hitting switches to get to the center, kill a Battlelord or two, and hit the auto destruct nuke.

!!! Tiberius Station

Finally on the moon. Not sure how though after the experience at Occupied Territory! The station (named after Captain Kirk's middle name) is covered with radioactive slime and lots of enforcers. A pretty straightforward level that goes by pretty quickly.

!!! Lunar Reactor

Another moon level. This one is notable for its theme song, which remains one of the most popular songs from the DN3D soundtrack. A large level with a nuclear reactor and a Battlelord or two. Some good lines here too! Poor Luke...

!!! Dark Side

The lunatic is on the grass... a good old level combining elements from Pink Floyd, Star Wars, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. The transports connecting different parts of the base together were pretty revolutionary at the time. Beautiful music and lots of enemies, including a pack of sentry drones and a Battlelord guarding the monolith that leads to the heart of the alien moon invasion. Lunatic Fringe, the 2nd secret level in the episode, can also be accessed near the end of the level.

This is also one of the longest levels in the game.

!!! Lunatic Fringe (secret level)

Is the second secret level. This level is tough because of the two Battlelords in the central area. This level was also revolutionary because the player was required to run 720 degrees around the arena before he could get back to the starting point. Aside from the enemies though, this level is short and sweet.

!!! Overlord

Contains the Overlord. Almost a pure boss level. Kill another Battlelord, jump down the ventilation shaft, and battle the master of the moon invasion. Duke humiliates the Overlord in ways that we shall not speak of.
