!! The Birth

The Birth is the fourth episode in Duke Nukem 3D, and is only available in the Atomic Edition of the game. It is set in a variety of fairly unrelated places. Secret footage shows a woman giving birth to... something, surrounded by a herd of not-seen-before aliens. After seeing this, Duke sets off from the secret missions facility, through a fast food restaurant, a theme park and a post office, towards an alien spaceship and the Alien Queen.

!!! It's Impossible

If it really was "mission impossible", why are there so many of them? Surely it should be "mission quite difficult but give me a while and I'll come up with something".

Enjoy playing Tom Cruise while hanging in from the ceiling. You also get to see your first Protector Drone.

!!! Duke-Burger

Happy Meals just don't quite cut it. Nice jab at the fast food industry too!

!!! Shop-N-Bag

WHOA!

Clean-up on aisle 4!

!!! Babe Land

Damn, that mouse is annoying.

Time to spin, shoot, ride and then play Pirates!

!!! Pigsty

It's what's around a pig's neck.

This is were you get some help from an unknown assailant, listen to the pigs die!

!!! Area 51 (secret level)

Because it wouldn't be Area 51 if there weren't a horde of aliens lurking around.

!!! Going Postal

Have you noticed those letters just go round in one big circle?

Its also time to play Defence.

!!! XXX-Stacy

Yes, quite.

A short but oh soo very sex......... errrr sweet map.

!!! Critical Mass

A very important religious meal.

Don't get squished! The whole building comes down.

!!! Derelict

Like the level 'Dark Side', this level is massive. Most probably the biggest and the well designed levels in the game.

Have fun here shooting the crap out of the jam-packed ship were there are Protector Drones around every corner. Chuck some mini Battlords in there to make things worse.

!!! The Queen

This is one queen you'd rather not visit. Tons of Protectors, too!!!
