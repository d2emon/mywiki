!! Mascot Fighting game

Mascot Fighting games, often called 'party brawlers', are fighting games usually developed to showcase a particular brand's line up of intellectual properties. Unlike traditional fighting games, mascot fighting games allow for up to four characters on the screen at a given time, up to three of which may be computer controlled. These games are played similarly to traditional fighting games, with the exception that stages in mascot fighting games are usually bigger than those in traditional fighting games and may or may not have platforms, allowing for vertical combat. Another feature exclusive to mascot fighting games is the ability for items to spawn on stage, giving a lesser skilled players assistance against tough opponents. A stage hazard, which is an attack at an area of the stage that causes damage to players that are unfortunate enough to get caught in it, may appear that players will have to look out for, unless the feature is turned off for the match. Notable releases in this genre are Super Smash Bros, Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion, and PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
