Maze games have a playing field which is entirely a maze, which players must navigate. Quick thinking and fast reaction times are encouraged by the use of a timer, monsters obstructing the player's way, or multiple players racing to the finish. The most famous game of this genre is Pac-Man. One of the earliest maze games was Rogue, played on a 28x40 text terminal on Version 7 Unix systems in 1980, each level consisting of 9 rooms, with a dungeon theme.
