!! Heroes of Might & Magic 3,5: In the Wake of Gods

(:childlist:)

Attach:ZDEC01.JPG

As told in an ancient legend, the fertile ground of Erathia and all creatures occupying her was created by the Gods who grew tired of their immortality. Having conceived of this world, they did not interfere with the course of events and could not even foresee them, and so from this fickle world they received truly divine pleasure …

Another legend says completely the opposite. One fine day, Divine Will shall intrude into the world created by the gods and will disturb the measured life of everyone who occupies it …

But let us put aside old legends. We will think up our own. You are not the God. You are just a Hero of Erathia. And now, it is time for you to act …

!!! 8th Level Monsters

All was silent and quiet in Erathia for a long time while both the forces of darkness and the forces of light did not intervene. But the forces of darkness grew impatient, desiring power and control over Erathia. And what is the best way to subdue the world? Force! So in order to bring their new devilish order to the world, terrible mutants were brought to life-- monsters of 8th level. And to stand against them, the forces of light were forced to do the same.

!!!! Basic Description:

All 8th level monsters are divine in essence, and therefore cannot be recruited the same way other monsters are recruited. To recruit 8th level monsters it is necessary to capture a dwelling of the appropriate monster. To do so, you will have to battle against several 8th level monsters. Immediately after capturing a dwelling it is possible to recruit the monster into the hero's army. If you delay, the monster will no longer be available there and after the initial recruitment, you will also no longer find them at their dwelling.

However, on day one of each week, for each 8th level external dwelling controlled by the player, one 8th level monster from that dwelling will be available to be recruited from any town owned by the player in which the appropriate 7th level dwelling has been built. However, this is a total number of these monsters available to the player that week, regardless of which town or towns owned by the player they are recruited from. For example, if you control two Storm Temples and also own two Tower castles, each with a 7th level dwelling built, you could recruit 1 Lord of Thunder at each castle, or 2 at one and none at the other as you choose. Note that the presence of one or more 8th level monsters at a 7th level castle dwelling is in addition to the 7th level monsters there and not instead of them.

The 8th level monsters have an extreme level of individuality and because of this you may only recruit one at a time, and if not recruited during the week, their number will not add to the following week's. Thus, if you have two external Storm Temples, then after recruiting one Lord of Thunder, the second one will become available. Also realize, that if you try to recruit 8th level monsters by clicking on the castle in the town screen where all monsters of all levels can be recruited, you will not find them; they can only be found by clicking directly on the 7th level dwelling in the town screen.

Each time an 8th level dwelling is captured by a different player, the new owner has the opportunity to immediately recruit the 8th level monster there even if a monster has already been recruited this week by another player.

!!!! Supreme Archangel (Castle)

One day, the Knight Orrin received an order to deliver a message to the neighboring kingdom. Life was peaceful, and so he took only one Archangel and a few Crusaders as guards for his journey. This seemed more than enough protection so Orrin set off. On the second day of his journey, a completely unfamiliar fiery monster suddenly arose from beneath the ground. The fight was short and deadly. Although the Archangel resurrected brave Orrin's crusaders, his small army was still unable to resist so strong an enemy. Orrin's troops were defeated and Orrin, wounded by the beast, was finally forced to flee. With great effort he eventually reached his native kingdom.

This story might have been quickly forgotten had not two circumstances determined the further course of events:

The monster that attacked Orrin and his troops had never been seen or heard of before. It was incredibly powerful and had the terrible ability to steal an enemy's soul;

The Archangels' honor was at stake, since one of them had fallen in an unequal fight. Orrin prayed long and hard with the clerics and called for protection from the Heavens. Although usually silent, this time the Heavens answered his call and sent a boon: new powers were granted to some Archangels. And that is how the Erathian Supreme Archangels came to be. Their new ability and improved resurrection skills further increased the morale of the armies they accompanied.

!!!! Diamond Dragon (Rampart)

Beginning one fateful day, affairs in the rampart went wrong. For unknown reasons, gems began to vanish. The situation threatened to get out of control, as these gems were absolutely necessary for the rampart’s building needs. The community of the Elder Dendroids agreed that they had need of the wisdom of the Magic Wood, so they decided to travel there and ask for help.

Having reached the Wood, they asked for guidance and were led to the base of a cliff where they were amazed by what they saw: the dazzling beauty of a dragon from whose mouth, instead of sulfur fumes, came fire and jewels. The Magic Wood granted the Elder Dendroids one of these sparkly dragons and the inhabitants of the rampart gratefully accepted the gift. In addition to the gems it provided, the new dragon proved a powerful ally.

Later, the reason for the missing gems was found out. A black knight spy from the necropolis had been stealing them! But he was caught in the act, and was seized, and hung from the nearest tree where he soon became a barbecued lesson for other would-be spies.

!!!! Lord of Thunder (Tower)

A titan once got caught in a thunderstorm on his way home. He paid it little attention, for as everyone knows, titans are so hardy that an act of nature can’t normally harm them. The horrible lightning struck him in the head and crackled through is body, exiting through his foot. This did not faze him at all and he continued on his way. Ten minutes later he got into an ambush with power liches. There were a lot of them and their quantity might become their best quality. The titan did not know dialectics, and so their numbers did not deter him. Being a soldier of fortune, he had agreed to lose his life in a battle and started fighting.

While fighting, he began to realize that the power liches’ death cloud caused much less harm to him than usual. In addition to taking less damage, our titan hero discovered he was now able to attack twice as often as his opponents. As the undead losses mounted higher, the power liches started to fall back, unsure if they could win. And while their optimism dropped, the titan's grew, until suddenly he found that he had exhausted his supply of thunderbolts. What to do? There was only hand-to-hand combat now and so the titan rushed bravely into the thinned crowd of enemies. And threw as another surprise! Every stroke that hit an opponent was accompanied by a bolt of powerful lightning that came down from the clear blue sky. The fight ended in victory for the titan.

Having returned, he told all about the miracle that happened to him. The elder mages consulted and conferred and finally decided that this could not have come about without the intervention of higher Elemental Forces. And since that time, titans who have been found worthy have followed the Divine Call and gone on a journey of empowerment. They have constructed storm temples in far off places amidst the fiercest of storms. While dwelling within these temples that struck many times a day by the bolts of lightning, the titans have gained their new powers.

!!!! Antichrist (Inferno)

Some people refer to the dark forces as "disturbers of calmness" because they cannot be content any place where around them is peace and harmony.

In the deepest and darkest levels of Hell, the forces agreed to create the new perfect monster that could subdue Erathia and all adjoining lands. And no sooner said than done. In the world has appeared the antichrist -- an awful fiery monster against whom no other spirit could stand. His authority over souls is practically boundless.

!!!! Blood Dragon (Necropolis)

Necromancers always wanted to strengthen vampires so that it was possible to drain the blood and life force from all creatures in the land. However it is not so simple to create a very strong vampire because despite their undead powers, their bodies are merely augmented human flesh.

And so it was reasoned that it would be much easier to impart the vampire’s abilities to a more powerful essence - to a ghost dragon. A ghost dragon and some vampires were sent to the spectral vault where the long process of creating a new and terrible mutant, the blood dragon, began.

!!!! Darkness Dragon (Dungeon)

Sadly, it is often the case that childish mischief brings about tragedy. Perhaps it is adults who are to blame for this, but what difference does it make when all is said and done? The damage is done and it is often hard to tell who was wrong and who was right. So it was that once a young Black Dragon pushed another off a cliff during a playful fight and the second dragon, too young for its wings to support it, was killed in the fall.

Law and order in the dungeon are severe by outside standards, and according to the law, even the young must be answerable for their deeds. The mighty Dragon ancestors made up their minds and the decision was final: three hundred years in jail. Cruel? Perhaps. But the law is the law.

At first the dragon sulked and pouted. Then he raged against those who imprisoned him. But years passed, then decades and even centuries. The young black dragon grew, and his isolation provided perspective. He also gained in strength and developed into a powerful dragon during his long, dark imprisonment. Bereft of light, and limited in his companionship to his guards, he had nothing to do but train himself within the dark confines of his cavernous prison.

Three hundred long years passed. The sentence was complete, and the dragon was finally released. As he slowly flew from his prison, all were awed by his striking appearance. His scales, which had not seen a ray of light since his imprisonment, were so dark that they actually seemed to absorb and transform light into shadows. All those close to him were cloaked in darkness, and none could see any farther than their own hand. The dragon's eyes, in contrast, were able to see everything with no difficulty at all.

Soon, another byproduct of the dragon's sentence became evident, for when he attacked an enemy, the target was lost in the darkness, while the dragon could freely return to his original position without having to suffer retaliation. His reputation and power grew within warlock society, and soon he was the most revered dragon within the realm. In time, the dragon fathered others like him, though his offspring, blessed with the same traits as he and known as darkness dragons, were always far less common than the traditional red and black dragon varieties.

!!! Ghost Behemoth (Stronghold)

In the early days of the barbarian world, death was but another journey to the halls of the afterworld where all who have gone before gather to feast and pay tribute to the first fathers; second only to reverence for those who have gone before is the acquisition and use of Power. So it is no surprise that the first ancient behemoth, a being of tremendous strength, enjoyed absolute authority. Barbarians from all across the barbarian empire would travel on pilgrimages to gaze upon its magnificence. The glory of the behemoth was known throughout the barbarian lands, and it was famed for its valor.

The behemoth's rule lasted for centuries and not a single war march, not a single military solution, was possible without its approval. For long years, life was good for the Barbarian people, and they offered up prayers of thanks to their forefathers for sending them such a mighty protector. They became wealthy and gathered tribute from nearby kingdoms. The art of war prospered.

But nothing is eternal even in the barbarian world. The time came for the behemoth to leave its mortal existence and go into the halls of the forefathers. The ceremony proceeded according to ancient laws and everyone honored the Great Barbarian Hero who no longer walked among them.

With its passing, the barbarians tried to carry on as before, but with the behemoth gone, there was soon trouble. War marches failed. Vassals started murmuring. And strife grew among the clans. Brothers turned on each other, and sons challenged their fathers in defiance of law and tradition. All seemed to be going wrong...

So what to do now? Should the Barbarian people vanish after all? Never! The Council of Elders gathered and called out to their forefathers for help: "Return us our Great Defender! Return us our Hero to lead us once more to glory!" Would their plea be heeded? No one knew, either the forefathers would heed their entreaty or not--nobody could guess, only pray.

To their amazement and joy, the spirit of the mighty creature soon appeared in the Stronghold, and free of its living flesh, the power of it was far more terrible than ever before. The incredible news of its return spread rapidly through all barbarian lands and the people took heart with their powerful new leader--the ghost behemoth! Ancient behemoths also returned to the lands--mighty warriors to aid the ghost behemoth as the barbarians sought to once again return their lands to the traditions and paths of their forefathers.

!!!! Hell Hydra (Fortress)

It once chanced to happen that in a bog a rust dragon got itself stuck. It creaked and rasped and finally rusted. It stood as a monument in the middle of the bog for many years.

But one day, finally, this piece of rusty iron attracted hydras, and they decided to put it in their pond. Moving the old rusty dragon wasn't easy, and just as the hydras were about to settle it into their pond, the dragon's rusted skeleton began to fall apart. From within the rusty old dragon's ribcage they found its source of acid--the acid had mixed with the gassy swamp water over the years and had changed and become quite unstable. Without warning, it suddenly exploded, covering the hydras from snout to claw! But the hydras were not harmed, for it appeared that this new acid-swamp mixture was not dangerous to them at all. In fact, they liked it so much that they eagerly drank their fill. Oh the hydras had fun for days! They spat each other with acid and frolicked in the pond, unaware of how they were changing, transforming, mutating. Their hides took on a red acid shade and they gained new powers of regeneration. For the hydras this was like the water of life, and now they felt invincible!

!!!! Sacred Phoenix (Conflux)

The Fountain of Youth. A dream that has driven many to the point of obsession--eternal life, eternal youth. A dream--and yet one that persists through time and across cultures. Is it real? Most likely not, yet the legends persists. So, who knows? Anything is possible, right?

Certainly one man believes. Listen and judge for yourself the story of the Astral Wizard, an ardent collector of "sparkly bits" and now a prophet for the existence of the fountain of youth. In Mr. Wizard's own words, he was wandering in a distant, arid land searching for "some really nice red and blue sparkly bits" as a young man when he encountered the following:

"I saw a vision of palm trees ahead of me, an oasis in the glaring desert that surrounded me, and I thought, 'Well, there surely aren't any shiny baubles out here in all this sand. And I'm really thirsty.' I halfway expected it to vanish, a mirage like the transient nature of light refracting off a well-cut sparkly gem, but the palms were real, as was the crystal clear spring bubbling in the middle of the oasis. Trying not to trip over my robes, and hopeful that I'd be able to rinse some of the sand out of my hat, I knelt before the bubbling pool. As I reached out to the very nicely sparkling water, a strange thing happened---a huge bird, larger than a thunderbird or even a phoenix, rose up before me, feathers ringed in flames. The creature spoke in a thunderous voice. 'Mortal, you have found the fabled Fountain of Youth, a sacred spring forbidden to all but the most holy. I, the Sacred Phoenix, guard the waters of this holy place and only by defeating me can you drink of it. Be warned, for I am blessed with the speed of the thunder god's lightning, I burn with fires of the earth god's molten subterranean lakes, and I have drunk from the Fountain myself and am thus blessed with life even in defeat. Do you wish to face me?'

"Slightly taken aback, I quickly recovered my normal aplomb. 'Face you?' I said, 'Not a chance, but what say we swap? Err… uhm… how about this pretty blue rock I found yesterday in exchange for a sip?' The sacred phoenix immediately pounced on the rock, cooing to itself, 'Pretty, pretty, oh so sparkly' and I proceeded to take a deep drink from the water. Quite refreshing, I must say."

Truth? Fiction? Who can say? Certainly that loveable old coot, Astral Wizard, has been around for what seems like forever. Either way, should you ever have to face the sacred phoenix and you DON'T have a pretty blue sparkly bit, you should be prepared for one heck of a tough fight. Sacred phoenixes are rare, but deadly--incredibly fast, they have strong attacks, defend well, and deal a lot of damage. Much tougher than traditional phoenixes, their flames also burn hotter, causing fire damage to hand-to-hand attackers. It is rumored that their association with the Fountain of Youth means that they will always regenerate once after being "killed".

!!! Other New Monsters

From times of last great battles has passed a lot of time. Life does not cost on a place, and some monsters have managed to use a respite with advantage for themselves. A part from them is strengthened trained, developing new skills. At last, new monsters have appeared.

!!!! Ghost

Ghosts from Enroth. Yes, these callous creations have returned! Having neither flesh, nor blood, being to all indifferent, they kill all and draw forth the liberated souls. These Erathian ghosts have learned a few tricks since their time spent in Enroth; they have learned to withdraw the spirits of all creatures and creations on the battlefield. Now, not only living things can fill up the ranks of the ghosts, but also dead, and also not alive and not dead. Only instruments of war such as catapults and ballista are beyond the reach of their ghostly embrace.

!!!! Gorynych

Few outside the dark environs of the dungeon are aware that the warlocks of that realm hold a magic tournament every fifth year. The best and brightest warlocks and overlords compete, demonstrating their prowess in the four elemental schools of magic, their abilities to develop new potions and to create new creatures to serve the dungeon hierarchy. In each category, only one contestant is awarded the coveted Pendant of the Black Dragon--a badge of both prestige and power within the warlock world.

One of the most renowned warlocks of this (or any) age, Alamar, was the recipient of five such pendants--one each for earth, air, water and fire magic expertise, and one more for his Potion of Paralyzation, which he had distilled from the venom of a scorpicore. Yet, the sixth and final Pendant of the Black Dragon, for the best new creature, eluded him for many years.

One year, his carefully bred mushroom-detecting troglodytes were beaten by Agar's de-odorized harpies, while at the next contest, his porcupine/medusa mix took second to Gunnar's manure-free manticores. So it went--always his creatures were widely applauded but never quite good enough for the coveted pendant.

Finally, Alamar determined to expand his horizons--to blend non-native dungeon creatures to create something truly unique. He traveled far, through the lands of the elves, where he dabbled briefly with a dwarf/harpy mix (too heavy to fly), and the lands of the barbarians where he had a brief success with crossing evil eyes and cyclops until the other cyclops destroyed his prototype as an abomination (Ugh! Many eyes! Ugh!), before finally reaching the sulfurous swamps of the beastmasters. There he captured a young hydra before returning to his dungeon lair to begin preparations. A grand design--the speed of a dragon, with the many heads of the hydra. Multiple breathe attacks, and the ability to fly--truly a beast to strike fear in the heart of the stoutest kanniggit.

Unfortunately for Alamar, crossbreeding dragons and hydras proved to be much more difficult than he had imagined. His first attempt burned itself to death when one head tried to talk to another, while his second smashed to the ground when it was unable to fly and attack at the same time. The contest loomed and Alamar finally settled on a compromise: the gorynych—a multi-headed beast that attacked without retaliation, yet could fly and moved at least a little faster than a chaos hydra. Alas, his run of bad luck continued--the gorynych was showcased the same year that Jeddite developed his self-veiling medusas, and once again the Pendant he so coveted was denied to Alamar. Out of frustration and spite, Alamar released his prototype gorynyches into the wild, to snack on the unsuspecting and those who are foolish enough to attempt to wrap their tongues around the beasts' wholly unpronounceable name.

!!!! Arctic Sharpshooter

The sharpshooters, originally trained by Gelu, were so popular because of their combat skills that all heroes desired to have them as part of their army. And the prestige of being a sharpshooter was so strong that the skills and training were passed on from father to son and mother to daughter.

In due course, it was possible to find sharpshooters in almost every part of Erathia, and as you can expect, they tried to adapt to local conditions. So the arctic sharpshooters have appeared. They have an improved attack and are also able to hide in snow-covered places, which allows them to be better protected from missile fire..

!!!! Nightmare

Necromancers aren't the most social of heroes. The lack of living flesh and blood might be the problem, or maybe the weird clothes they tend to wear. It could be the strange cackling they tend to emit when they laugh, or perhaps it's just the constant stink of death that seems to surround them. Whatever the reason, they generally aren't invited out to the most fashionable of parties. Actually, they generally aren't invited out to ANY parties--fashionable or not. So, they have a lot of time on their bony old hands.

Especially since they don't sleep. They know of dreams and they know of nightmares, remembering vaguely as they do their time before undeath, though they no longer have either. Not surprisingly, they prefer nightmares--especially for other people.

Thus it was that Sandro, in a fit of jealousy over the livies ability to dream, took a few of the undead steeds that were normally used by the black knights and began "working" with them. He trained them to move on their own, without the guidance of a rider, and he changed their appearance to make them fiercer to gaze upon. Sandro also added his own personal scent of death to the new creatures and concentrated it in their "breath".

No amount of air freshener will help the hero who faces Sandro's nightmares, as he so cleverly called them, as the strength of their breath rivals that of the mighty gorgon, often bringing death instantly to even the mightiest of beasts. Indeed, so strong is the stench that sometimes even those standing behind the initial creature will be struck down, and no amount of breath mints will allay the damage done.

Sandro finds this all to be a fine joke, of course, and he loves to regale his acquaintances with his tale of creation. Not at parties, since the invites keep not coming for those, but at the local necromancer's guild meetings, or, better yet, at the Annual Deadies banquet. Everyone cackles with glee and tries not to lose his or her jaw bone in the process, as that can be quite embarrassing, even for one who already has no life, social or otherwise.

!!!! Santa Gremlin

Time waits for no man, it rolls along, like sands through the hourglass. Tick, tick, tick. All we are is dust in the wind and nothing lasts forever.

Except gremlins. Always there have been gremlins, always there will be gremlins. They worm their way into clocks, into ballistae, into titans' codpieces. Tinker, putter, snip, bang--it all goes awry. Such is life. Mischievous, mercurial, and prone to misadventure, they aren't evil, yet they are the demons that haunt our daily lives.

Many solutions to the gremlin problem have been tried--the wizards chain them up to try to keep them out of the machinery, but do you really think genies have always changed sex when upgraded? Not a chance. The result of a gremlin in the works, and no one has been able to figure out how to change the problem now that it exists. In the dungeon, the overlords test the new minotaur axes on the gremlins, and the warlocks try new spells, but there are always more. Barbarians feed them to orcs, beastmasters let the wyverns poison them, and heretics toss them into the fire lakes. The necros tried to make skeletons out of them, but the animation always seemed to go wrong, one leg walking in one direction while the other headed off somewhere else, perhaps taking the skull with it but forgetting to bring along the neck bones. And always there are more, mucking up the works and distributing headaches to everyone, high and low, rich and poor.

Legend has it that there was once a recluse wizard who actually managed to domesticate the gremlins. This wizard, known to today's world only as K, lived far to the North, farther even than his other winter wizard brethren. He was said to be a bit of an eccentric, wearing fuzzy red pajamas trimmed in white fur, and preferring a red stocking cap to the traditional wizard pointy hat. But all agree, that if he existed--and the evidence suggest that he did--he must have been a genius.

What evidence? The santa gremlin, believed to be a derivative of the common anti-gremlin cry, 'Blast, these gremlins are Satan spawn'. Santa gremlins are clothed in red, with white trim, and they command other gremlins or similar lowly creatures to protect them--just as K is said to have commanded the santa gremlins to protect him. Strangest of all, they are spell casters, capable of using the ice bolt spell--said to be K's favorite incantation. Their existence isn't proof positive that K really existed, but who else but an eccentric half frozen genius at the top of the world would come up with such a crazy idea?

Why a genius? Because santa gremlins not only follow instructions, they can also be nice. While they are tough in combat, capable of casting ice bolts and surrounded by traditional gremlin protectors, after combat, defeated santa gremlins have been known to give gifts to heroes as a reward for their victory. Such generosity and good will is unheard of in traditional gremlins, and only a genius could find a way to develop such traits in a race otherwise known only for their capricious and destructive natures.

!!!! Sorceress

It wasn't always easy growing up in the rampart--Petal knew this all too well. Everything was "nature this" and "environment that" and "no, we can't have any roasted marshmallows this evening because the dendroids get upset if we burn them in our bonfires." Silly, thought Petal, it's not like they won't grow back. Even her name. Petal. Blah--how terribly NOT fearsome. How many creatures or evildoers had ever trembled at the thought of the dreadful Petal coming for them? None, zero, zilch.

Nope, the rampart was not the place to be if you wanted to be a rock n' roll spell caster who preferred a good fireball to a boring old bless spell any day of the week. Oh, you could become a ranger like Jenova, or a druid, like Gem, but you still had to play by their rules. Don't walk on the grass, don't tie bells to the centaurs' tails, don't give the dwarves hot feet. Dull, dull, dull. Even the unicorns were a washout--prancing about, all pure and white and letting the other maidens pet their gleaming coats, but turning up their horns at Petal and her soot-blackened hands.

So, she left. Petal set out on her own to find independent women of a like mind. She had one of her more domestically inclined cousins make her a wicked looking dark cloak with a high, intimidating collar and hit the road. As she journeyed, Petal made little mental notes to herself: take out a few evildoers along the way, invent some flashy and dangerous spells, test her magic skills in the real world, and improve the fashion sense of civilized women everywhere.

Life was good. She was a fearsome spell-casting woman on a rampage, and to her surprise, there were many others like her. And not just from the ramparts--soon she had a band of "sisters" that consisted of former battle mages, overlords, heretics and all manner of other women. They called themselves the Sorceresses, and in honor of Petal, they all wore the same style long cloak with the wicked high collar.

As their numbers grew, so did their power. They cast all sorts of spells in combat--not just namby-pamby water spells, but also fun combat spells like disrupting ray, curse and even a nasty little creation of Petal's that afflicted the target with a nice little debilitating disease. Soon, their merry band became feared by practitioners of evil far and wide. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they soon became feared by men too--even those of good hearts and pure thoughts.

Concerned that their fun loving, free wheeling lifestyle was overshadowing their honest desire to help clean up the world, Petal went to a local enchanters' grove to discuss how the two groups could work together. Eventually, a pact was reached where the enchanters agreed that sorceresses of sufficient power could summon a small band of enchanters to assist in the battles against evil, thus helping to allay the growing belief that sorceresses were not just against evil, but against men in general. In return, Petal and her followers agreed not to cast Petal's nasty little disease spell on the enchanters, and to only summon enchanters that were not actively involved in playing Whack-A-Mage, the enchanters' favorite pastime.

!!!! Sylvan Centaur

Listen now, to one of Erathia's greatest love stories. Once upon a time there was a young elf named Tallow who fell in love with a beautiful centaur girl named Sherinda. But as is often the case with love that blossoms between different races, their union was forbidden. Elves and centaurs at this time were at loggerheads over many issues, not the least of which was who had to shovel out the unicorn pens and dragons caves. For many months the young lovers hid their desires from their people, meeting only in secret or in the dead of night. But as their passions grew, so did their restlessness, until finally they could stand it no longer, and they revealed their true feelings to their families. They had hoped for understanding, but instead were met with shock and despair. The fighting between the elves and centaurs was getting worse, and their romance was seen by both families as a betrayal.

When he refused to renounce his love for Sherinda, Tallow was cast out of his clan and forced to leave the rampart until such time as he would abide by the rule of the elves. Before he left, he got word to Sherinda to never give up hope--somehow he would find a way for them to be together and he would return for her.

Although Sherinda wasn't an outcast like Tallow, the centaurs watched her carefully and tried to find her a suitable male centaur instead. They tried all manner of suitors--manly, athletic centaurs and bookish, wise centaurs versed in the magical arts. But nobody could replace Sherinda's beloved Tallow in her heart, so it was a fruitless search.

For months, Tallow wandered the lands, unable to forget about his precious Sherinda, until one day he came upon a horrible scene--a terrified old woman tied to a stake, about to be burned alive by a small mob of villagers carrying pitchforks and lit torches. Tallow approached the villagers and demanded to know what crime the woman had committed to receive such a terrible punishment. They told him that she was a witch, that she had poisoned the village's well, and for that she must be burned, "because all witches are evil". The woman called out to Tallow, pleading for help and proclaiming her innocence. Elves seem to have a sixth sense when it comes to knowing who's good and who's not, and Tallow could tell at once that the woman bore no evil in her heart.

Knowing from personal experience what it was like to be persecuted, Tallow made a decision. He quickly unslung his cherrywood bow, and in the blink of an eye, his arrow had pierced the hat of the apparent ringleader of the mob. From the steely look in the elf's eyes it was clear that he meant business. When Tallow demanded the woman's freedom and challenged the villagers to fight, the cowards quickly turned and ran for the safety of their village.

After freeing the old woman, Tallow discovered that she was in fact a witch, but a good one, and she was grateful for being rescued. They traveled together for awhile, and when the witch heard of Tallow and Sherinda's plight, she offered a magical solution. It was a drastic one, however, for she described a spell that could put two creatures into one body if they had strong enough feelings for each other. Although it had never been tried with two different species, Tallow was willing to try anything for the woman he loved. So when the old witch and the young elf reached a village where the witch could make herself a new home without fear of persecution, she taught Tallow the proper incantation for the spell. After gathering the herbs he would need to accompany the spell, the elf departed on his journey back home--back to Sherinda.

Sadly, when Tallow arrived back at the rampart, he found that the elves and centaurs had declared war. The dwarves and dendroids tried to maintain order, but things were rapidly getting out of hand. If something wasn't done soon it would tear the once tight-knit community apart.

Stealthily making his way to Sherinda's stable, Tallow woke her, and she greeted him with amazement, joy, and quite a remarkable kiss, but also with concern. Quickly, he told her about the enchantment and asked if she was willing to join with him forever. Without hesitating for a moment, she agreed. Filled with nervous excitement, they performed the ritual together, and as the magic power suffused their spirits, they became one, unified in body, mind and soul. They were a new race, a sylvan centaur. And their name was Talinda.

When they emerged into the streets, everyone stopped and stared. Nobody had ever seen the likes of this creature before--part elf, part centaur, with the strengths of both and the weaknesses of neither. The news quickly spread and everyone came to see Talinda. Perhaps it was a side effect of the enchantment, or perhaps it was the incredible joy that radiated from Talinda, but instead of being cast out as an abomination, the sylvan centaur was revered by both the elves and the centaurs alike. Both races soon stopped fighting and they appointed Talinda as their spokesperson, a diplomat to both people.

In the following months and years, the enchantment was used numerous times, for it seemed that the races of elves and centaurs had more in common than they thought. Before long there were many sylvan centaurs in the town, and they were always very happy, for each one was a union of pure love.

They will be combined free of charge and at ratio 1:1, so after combining 42 Centaur Captains and 14 Grand Elves you'll end up with 14 Sylvan Centaurs and 28 Centaur Captains.

!!!! Werewolf

It's a curious fact of life that some mixes are more accepted than others. Peanut butter and jelly? A classic. Labradors and poodles? A bit odd, but they have a cool name--who wouldn't want a labradoodle? Men and horses? Peculiar, but centaurs move fast and generally are polite enough to go outside to take care of business--a significant improvement over horses and barbarians. Wolves and men? A downer--nobody seems to like the werewolf, perhaps because they shed profusely, or maybe because there's always the chance that they'll rip your throat out during a full moon rampage. At any rate, they have long been anathema, and many campaigns to exterminate lycanthropy in all its forms have been launched over the years--with varying results.

Certainly Lord Haart's crusade to eliminate werebeavers was a smashing success, much to the relief of regular beavers who often found their rivers and streams dammed with human femurs after the full moon, but others have been far less effective. Halon's attempt to eliminate the fearsome werehummingbird, for example, lead only to the vaporization of some lovely flower gardens and the destruction of a number of perfectly innocent bees.

Still, though there are many were-creatures in the world, werewolves have always been the most common and among the most dangerous. Werewolves are fast, much faster than the weresloth, for example, and while some lycanthropes retain some of their human attributes even in their moon-induced animal states, werewolves often go completely berserk during the full moon, beyond the control of anyone or anything. It is also true that, for reasons unknown, werewolves seem more likely to pass their affliction on to those they bite or claw than do most other werecreatures. Indeed, there are more than a few reports of werewolves transforming large numbers of normal men and creatures into werewolves during various struggles.

Attempts to eliminate werewolves have had mixed success, though in general they have been driven to living in the more remote areas of the world. Still, their speed, power and viciousness in battle has caused more than one would be hero to seek them out and attempt to convince them to join the ranks of their army. Werewolf forces are always to be feared, as there is the possibility for them to transform all they oppose into werewolves, both friend and foe, and the blood rage of the full moon is often so vicious as to blind them from any distinction between friend or foe, good and evil, or innocent and guilty.

!!!! Hell Steed

There are cracks in our world. Unseen places where the fabric of the universe is a bit weaker than in most other places. Animals can sense these places and stay away from them. Fear them. For sometimes, not often thankfully, but yet often enough to make brave souls cower behind the thin walls of their homes, something breaks through those cracks from the other side.

It is not dark on the other side, as many conjecture, but in fact it is quite, quite bright. Fire is like that. Bright. And hot. Very, very hot. So too the creatures that live in that fierce, inhospitable world just beyond our own, caught in passing mayhap in a dream--or, rather a nightmare. Only it's not always a nightmare. Sometimes, the fiery beasts from the other side find a crack in our world big enough to let them through. Sometimes, the nightmares are real--and hot.

Hell steeds are of the other world, burning horses, with flaming manes and searing eyes. Fortunately for us, they are small compared to some of their brethren from beyond, yet even they can only rarely find holes in the weave of the universe large enough to squeeze through. So, they remain rare, usually found in remote areas and places where large quantities of magic have accumulated without supervision. Places where the cracks are not repaired but left unattended, to be worried at and leveraged from the other side.

When they are encountered, hell steeds are usually feral in both appearance and demeanor, and their breath is said to be so hot that they will often, briefly, leave walls of fire in their wake. Additionally, it is believed that some of the older hell steeds have learned how to harness their heat and project it across small distances. Attacking these hell-born equines is perilous, as direct hand-to-hand attacks will almost certainly result in the burning of the attacker, perhaps severely.

Naturally, the hell steed is immune to fire-based magic. Born in the nightmare world on the other side, the hell steeds have no fear of our own world.

!!!! Dracolich

A long time ago, a powerful lich king in a far off land experimented with dragon animation. Mixing the bones of a black dragon and a faerie dragon and imbuing them with evil power, the dracolich was born. Although this terrifying undead creature casts no spells, its magic is able to block many non-magical attacks. And like the liches, the Dracolich can throw a death cloud at its opponents from far away, but its power reserves are quickly drained. This is rarely a problem, however, because the Dracolich relishes the chance to toast its foes with fiery breath and then devour the barbecued treat.

Recently, these dracoliches have begun showing up in Erathia, spreading terror and death in their wake.

!!! Commanders

After the balance of different forces on Antagarich was disturbed and after the intervention of the gods many heroes realized that they might not be able to fight on their own any more. They needed help. They needed intelligent creatures to aid them not only on the battlefield but also in leading their army. They needed personal commanders. That title soon was beginning to be the property of heroes' best friends, relatives or the most talented and strongest generals.

!!!! Basic Description:

Commanders are somehow a combination of a hero and a creature. They fight on the battlefield along with your hero, but they also gain the same experience - and with that: new levels, primary skills, secondary skills and better statistics overall. They can also use special artifacts, cast a spell and they have some specialties of their own. They all have different names and biographies, but at start they do have many similarities. Each hero can have only one commander. If he currently has no commander, he may recruit one at any of your towns for the price of 1000 gold.

You can check your commander screen by clicking on the icon in your hero screen:

At start every commander has the same statistics:

||
||Attack: ||5||
||Defense: ||5||
||Speed: ||5||
||Hit Points: ||60||
||Damage: ||7-15||
||Spell Power: ||1||

They will be modified by the choice and development of the commander's primary skills, as well as by his own experience and gaining new levels.

If a commander dies in battle, but the hero's army manages to win or flee, it will be possible to later resurrect him at one of your towns. However this will most likely cost you gold and sometimes you will even have to have a mage guild of a certain level built.

A commander screen on a battlefield shows also his special abilities and looks like this:

The abbreviations are as follows:

L: - Commander Level
MP: - Magic Power
MR: - Magic Resistance

Then you can also see a short list of the commander's secondary skills.

In this example they are: Maximum Damage, Unlimited Retaliations, Attacking Twice and Fearsome.

Besides that we can see that our commander can cast Cure 2 times each battle.

!!!! Paladin (Castle)

As a divine defender of justice, this holy avenger's abilities grow stronger with every battle won. The Paladin has also been blessed with healing magic to keep the troops alive and fighting strong.

* Wise - Gains 150% of Hero's experience
* Cure - May cast Cure

!!!! Hierophant (Rampart)

These mystical Commanders are natural healers, always insisting on at least one first aid tent for any army they command. In battle, they protect the lives of their troops by conjuring a magical shield to ward off deadly blows.

* First Aid Master - Additional First Aid Tents, Number = Commander Level
* Shield - May cast Shield [Duration = Magic Power]

!!!! Temple Guardian (Tower)

Strong willed and intelligent, the beautiful Temple Guardian is a distant cousin to the titans. Her presence on the battlefield improves the ranged accuracy of titans as well as the other troops she commands. This power is almost as useful as her innate ability to draw forth and channel mana from an emotionally-charged field of battle.

* Mana Magician - Restores some spell points for Hero if he/she has lost them since previous Commander turn (number = Lost Mana *(20% + 5% * Commander Level)) but no less than 1 Point and no more than 90% of Lost Points
* Precision - May cast Precision [Duration = Magic Power]

!!!! Succubus (Inferno)

Always sensual and charming, your ranks will soon swell with creatures entranced under this demonic Commander's spell. The Succubus' affinity for fire lets her protect her minions with an aura of flame.

* Charming - Steals a portion of neutral stacks before combat. Formula is 5%+(Commander Level-1)/2 but not more than 20%
* Fire Shield - May cast Fire Shield [Duration = Magic Power]

!!!! Brute (Dungeon)

A fearless fighter in battle, this Commander inspires bloodlust in the troops he or she commands. And when it's all over, the Brute directs the army to gather up the corpses, for there is always a demand for fresh bodies in the dark and smelly depths of the dungeon.

* Soul Reformer - Gives 50% of battle experience in gold
* Bloodlust - May cast Bloodlust [Duration = Magic Power]

!!!! Soul Eater (Necropolis)

These soulless Commanders absorb the spiritual essence of the creature they kill to sustain them in their unnatural unlife. On the battlefield, the Soul Eater uses her necromantic powers to reanimate her fallen undead comrades.

* Undead - Has the properties of an undead creature
* Animate Dead - May cast Animate Dead on Level 1-5 Creatures [HP Number = (Magic Power/4)*50+60 ]

!!!! Ogre Leader (Stronghold)

The resourceful Ogre Leaders have fallen in love with the deadly ballista and always make sure there's at least one in any army they command. These cunning Commanders have also mastered a spell that makes their troops' skin as hard as stone.

* Ballista Master - Provides additional Ballistas #=Commander Level/4+1 (plus control)
* Stone Skin - May cast Stone Skin [Duration = Magic Power]

!!!! Shaman (Fortress)

This adept Commander uses primal magic to become much stronger in battle, drawing upon the spiritual totem of the hero who leads the army. The Shaman's spells increase both the speed and reflexes of the Fortress beasts to which he or she is attuned.

* Superior Combat Ability - 150% of Hero's Attack and Defense
* Haste - May cast Haste (Speed + 5) [Duration = Magic Power]

!!!! Astral Spirit (Conflux)

Originating on the astral plane, this Commander's ability to reveal glimpses of an empty and desolate world often make the once-loyal soldiers of sworn enemies cast down their weapons, having seen the futility of war. The Astral Spirit also possesses telepathy and can sometimes warn friendly troops of a surprise attack from behind.

* Pacifist - Elemental + 5%+(Commander Level-1)/2 (maximum 20%) of Creatures in enemy Hero's army run away.
* Counterstrike - May cast Counterstrike [Duration = Magic Power]

!!! Commanders' Skills

!!!! Primary Skills 

Every commander can have 4 out of 6 possible primary skills. Every skill has 5 levels. When gaining a level you will be able to chose boosting any of your four chosen primary skills.

!!!! Secondary Skills 

By advancing in levels your commander can have 6 out of 15 possible secondary skills. These skills have no 'levels', so you can't develop them in any way. The commander may learn a particular skill only if he had already learned two specific primary skills and have the Master level in both of them. When advancing in level you'll then be able to choose between learning a higher level of one of your four primary skills or learning a secondary skill.

!!! Town Demolition

''Now towns can be destroyed and rebuilt again from their ashes.''

To destroy a building in a town, it is necessary to right-click on the building you wish to destroy. You must have a visiting hero present at a town in order to destroy buildings there; a garrisoned hero cannot destroy anything.

Buildings cannot be destroyed in just any order, but must follow priorities and dependence (see Appendix Table 1). If all conditions for destruction of the given building in the given town are met, the building can be destroyed and a window will appear asking if you wish to destroy it. An example can be seen in the picture shown below:

If the given building cannot be destroyed at present, then when you right-click you will only see the standard information about that building.

If the player clicks the OK button to destroy a building, a check will be made to see if the hero has the minimum required level of experience. There is a minimum level at which heroes receive the ability to destroy buildings, and this is initially set to 1000 points for all buildings in all towns. However, this value can be changed with ERM code for any type of building for all types of towns (!!CD:E).

If the hero doesn't have enough experience, the appropriate message will appear stating that the building will not be destroyed. The next stage is a check of how strong the hero's army is. This is calculated as the sum of health (HP) of all monsters in the hero's army. The minimum level that is initially set for this calculation is 2000 HPs but this can also be changed with ERM (!!CD:A). If the hero's army is insufficient, an appropriate message will appear stating this.

If the destroyed building is a creature dwelling, it is checked to see if it has inhabitants. If the dwelling is not empty, a choice is offered to the player: pay the monsters to abandon the dwelling or fight them:

The cost of paying the monsters is calculated based on their level and number, as shown in the following table:

|| 
||Monster||Standard||Upgrade||
||Level 1||40||50||
||Level 2||60||75||
||Level 3||80||100||
||Level 4||150||200||
||Level 5||300||400||
||Level 6||550||650||
||Level 7||800||1000||

If you decline to pay, there is only one way to get rid of the monsters -- fight:

Here again you can refuse. Thus of any destructions. If in fight with monsters you will lose, that, being more peaceful, than you, monsters will release the hero on freedom. The truth of army he can lose completely.

If you pay the monsters or beat them in combat, it is possible to start the destruction. However, destroying buildings costs and each building has its own cost, but always in gold. Refer to Appendix 1 for the full list of buildings in all types of towns where you can look up the cost of destruction (Table1).

Each time you destroy a building, it displeases the local population of the town. In order to appease them, it is necessary to distribute gold with each following destruction. The amount of gold depends on the number of destructions done that day and can be seen in the following table:

||
||Destructions per day||Cost||
||First||0||
||Second||1000||
||Third||2000||
||Fourth||5000||

From the table you can see that four destructions per day are possible. However, this value can be changed by means of ERM commands (!! CD:D). If this number is altered, you may find it necessary to establish or change the price of destruction (!! CD:N).

The sum which it is offered to pay, at once includes all expenditure:

If you attempt to destroy a Grail building, you're given an opportunity to dismantle it instead. Since it's a valuable structure, it costs 10000 gold to dismantle it -- this is much more expensive than simply destroying it. If you pay this amount, the Grail will be dismantled and will appear in the hero's backpack:

If you have no free space in a backpack, you will not be able to dismantle the Grail.

An every next destruction needs some movement points of Hero. By default one destruction takes 55MP but may be changed by ERM (!!CD:M).

After destruction of a building the hero will find a small amount of resources in the ruins. They can be any resource except for gold. The exact quantity and type of resources can be checked in the Appendix (Table 1).

To completely destroy a town, it isn't necessary to destroy all the structures. It's enough to destroy the ones of key importance until finally reaching and destroying the Town Hall. Once the Town Hall has been destroyed, the remaining inhabitants abandon the town.

After destruction of the Town Hall, ghosts will appear in an ex-blacksmith's. However, they are too happy to be alive (dead?) and will not pay any attention to you. Thus, the town becomes absolutely empty. When your hero leaves the town, he will receive an appropriate message. If you leave wish you can leave the town under the protection of monsters or a hero by leaving them in the garrison, but be cautious. As soon as your hero leaves the town, he cannot enter again; the gates are locked and any guards left are controlled by the ghosts.

For the next 6 days, the town is completely closed to entry by all heroes. It ceases to belong to you and becomes neutral. After 6 days have passed, you can return to the town. If you have left guards you will have to enter combat and win against them before you can take over the town again.

So what happened during those 6 days? The ghosts enjoyed their freedom in the town but now they are bored and ready to go anywhere rather than fly around in the dead "ghost" town any longer. Click on the ex-blacksmith building to hire the ghosts:

The ghosts do not like to remain in the town, therefore they can only be hired into a visiting hero's army (bottom slot) and not into the garrison. Until all ghosts will not be hired, the town will remain deserted and will again become neutral as soon as the hero in it leaves. Again, you can leave guards at this point if you wish but if you later return you will have to fight them to regain control.

After hiring all ghosts, the hero can try to restore the town. For this purpose it is required to right-click on the ex-smithy as the new city inhabitants do not want haunted ghost houses in their town. The standard check for a hero with high enough experience and a strong enough army is made at this time as well. If he passes this check and if he's a hero native to this town type, he can only restore the town to its original type. However, if the hero is from another town, he can choose between the town's old type (before destruction) or his own native town type:

If the Hero has the Builder specialty (by default Jeddite) he can choose among all types of towns:

After destruction of the ex-blacksmith, at last, the city is restored. If the type of city is changed, a change of a landscape must be made but this takes some time, therefore the new local residents promise to finish it for when you next visit (enter the town).

!!! Arrow Towers

Arrow towers now can train and collect experience in fights. If the player keeps control of a town for one week, the arrow towers on day 1 will receive additional experience and are amplified according to the following formula:

||
||No Bonus||100% damage||
||After 1 week||200% damage||
||After 2 weeks||300% damage||
||After 3 weeks||400% damage||
||After 4 weeks||500% damage||

and so on...

If a town successfully defends against a siege, it gets better as though one week had passed. If a town is captured, all saved up experience for towers is lost.

The central shooting tower receives experience irrespective of the lower towers. The lower arrow towers receive experience simultaneously since they were both built at the same time.

!!! Selectable Combat Attack Mode

If a creature stack has more than one type of attack, this may be selected on the creature's turn by right-clicking the Defend button and choosing from the menu. The attack-mode choice for this stack will then last until the end of the current combat.

Modes that may be selected are:

# Shoot/Melee attack, for ranged attackers;
# Cast Spell/Melee attack, for creatures that cast spells as an action;
# Attack & Return/Attack without Return, for creatures with the Attack & Return ability (e.g., harpies).

If a creature has more than two attack modes available, there will be multiple options in the menu to choose from. For example, a shooting creature with the attack & return ability would be able to choose from any of them.

!!! New Specializations of Heroes

A lot of change has occurred in this land these past few years. Therefore, it is not surprising that some Heroes have gained new specialties during this time. But whether they are good ones or not, who can say?

!!!! 1. Specialty: Veil of Darkness.

!!!!! Basic Hero: Nagash (Necromancer).

In childhood, Nagash liked to sit for hours under the black shadow of the Veil of Darkness. Because he was a necromancer, he did not like society and always tried to disappear from sight. And thus, the Veil of Darkness drew him like a magnet. He was intrigued by how it functioned, and after much study he finally understood. In essence, it was extremely simple and only required a source of mana to be channeled. Long years of training have allowed Nagash to perfect this useful ability and now he wastes no time in taking advantage of the skill.

!!!!! Mobile Veil of Darkness.

When the hero moves, the shroud is replaced in a circle around him for all players who are not allies. Radius of the shroud circle is determined by the following formula:

# Take the lesser of current spell points or (knowledge x 10).
# This number is divided by 10 and then 0.5 is added.
# Minimum radius is 1.5.

Example: Nagash has a knowledge of 10 and 63 mana remaining. For the entire day, when he moves he will leave behind a black shroud with a radius of 6.5 tiles (diameter of 13 tiles). Possible consequences: In case the full current amount of mana is more, than a level of knowledge*10 each day is automatically subtracted 2 mana.

ERM Script:  !!HE#X8/1;

!!!!  2. Specialty: Builder.

!!!!! Basic Hero: Jeddite (Warlock).

In youth, Jeddite traveled all over the world, and everywhere he went he was amazed at the beauty of unfamiliar cities. Being very curious and observant, he always asked local masons how such cities were constructed. Now, having this knowledge, he is able to direct the construction of any type of city that is being rebuilt..

Allows Hero to choose any type of city when rebuilding one that has been completely destroyed.

ERM script:  !!HE#X8/2;

!!! Blessings and Curses. Sphinx

From time to time, lost wanderers have come across these mysterious constructions, fashioned in a similar style to the pyramids. They have been found at the slopes of mountains, in deserts, and even on plains. Seeking shelter from the cold or the heat, exhausted by famine and thirst, tired from long days on the road, these travelers tried to take refuge in these unusual constructions and, perhaps, find something that would allow them to continue their journey. Having come back home, they related to everyone about the unusual creation that met them with riddles at its entrance.

The sphinx shows you a randomly chosen riddle and asks you to answer it i.e. to type what you believe is the correct answer into a text-input field. The answer can consist only of one word (or a single letter), without additional punctuation marks or blanks. The case of the entered word is not important.

After typing the text click the OK button. The sphinx will check your answer, and depending on whether or not it's correct, either reward your hero, or punish him. In either case you can see result in the section of blessings and curses on the hero screen.

If you click on this icon, you will either see a brief message that the given Hero has no blessings or curses, or you will see a window with the icons displaying the current set of blessings and curses for this hero. In the latter case, each icon designates one blessing or curse. If you move the cursor over any of these  icons, you will see a text description for that blessing or curse:

Each one has two characteristics: power and duration. The first can be quantitative (for example, the Hero receives 158 gold coins per day) or qualitative (for example, the Hero can not visit any Gardens of Revelation). The second, always quantitative, shows how many days the curse or blessing will last. Some curse effects end at the beginning of the last day for that curse while others end at the end of the day. Therefore, effects of that latter will appear to last 1 day longer.

!!! Bonuses of Gods. Gods' Representatives

The influence of Gods which is carried out by means of Emissaries (Gods’ Representatives) is a completely new element in the world of Heroes. The more the Gods are convinced of the faithfulness of a Hero, the more assistance they provide...

To find out which GR the Hero has and what his accumulated bonus is, right-click on the God Bonus section in the hero screen:

Depending on the type of GR, the type of bonus and the icon in God Bonus section changes. When a hero receives Gods’ Representative (GR) he will begin to increase one of his primary skills every week.

||
||type||bonus||
||Emissary of War||Attack +1…3 every week||
||Emissary of Peace||Defense +1…3 every week||
||Emissary of Mana||Magic Power +1…3 every week||
||Emissary of Lore||Knowledge +1…3 every week||

At the beginning of every week, the value of the Bonus is calculated randomly from 1 to 3 for every GR individually. When a hero first gains a GR, he immediately receives a bonus of 1 to the skill in which the GR is specialized. If a Hero transfers a GR to another hero, gets rid of him or loses him in combat, all accumulated bonuses are lost. By transferring a GR to another player, the bonus starts to increase at the beginning of the new week for the new owner of the GR. Each Hero can only have 1 GR in his army, regardless of type.

!!! Leaving Your Army And Artifacts On The Map

To leave a part of a hero's army for protection of territory was a dream of many Heroes. But, as it is known, the most terrible thing about dreams is that sometimes they come true...

Now a hero can leave part of his army or an artifact on the map in any empty, passable square.

To leave an army or an artifact, it is necessary to right-click with the mouse on any free square adjacent to the hero, and then you will see a window with the offer to leave guards or an item:

If you right-click on a square that isn't empty or is impassable, the standard information about the object or the ground will be displayed.

In case of making a decision to leave part of your army, the standard dialogue for an exchange of monsters will be shown (like in the case of visiting a garrison):

If you decide to leave an artifact (you must remember to put it in the backpack first), you will see a window with the choice of which artifact to leave:

!!!! Other notes:

* The hero can leave only one type of creature [picture];
* Not all types of creatures can be left (for example, leaving ghosts is impossible) [picture];
* The army that is left is adjusted aggressively to all Heroes;
* The army will escape (without an option for fighting) from all Heroes controlled by the player who left the army, thus an army that is left in this fashion cannot be taken back by the original owner [picture] UNLESS you turn on the option 'troops left will rejoin their owner' - then previously left creatures will rejoin you free of charge when you 'attack' them.

!!! Stack Experience

* AI stacks in a garrison may gain stack experience in a turn if AI heroes elsewhere gained experience because AI stack experience is calculated slightly differently using a formula. Also, WoGify scripts options may give neutral (unowned) creature stacks experience if enabled.

!!!! Combining Experienced Stacks

The stack experience screen shows a stack’s current experience, current rank, stat and special ability bonuses, any stack artifacts carried and other pertinent details. Special abilities not yet gained will have a greyed-out pictured. To see more information about a special ability, right-click on the ability. To see more stack information details, right-click on the creature portrait located in the upper-left of the stack experience screen.

Note: a stack's statistic bonuses won't be visible (other than in the experience details screen) except in combat, and special ability bonuses are not displayed in the normal creature ability window.

!!!! Blank Artifacts:

WoG now also includes 10 new 'blank' artifacts that have no hard-coded usage or description but can be scripted through ERM. They are there for you - to finally make an artifact you always wanted to have :). You will find them in the 'artifacts' section of the editor after 'Pandora's Box'.

!!! Scripts

WoG introduces a new script engine called ERM (Event Related Model). It can be used to change many properties of creatures, objects, artifacts, etc., or to create completely new events and situations. Many such scripts have been already created and added to the game. You will find them in the 'data/s' directory in your main 'heroes 3' folder and you can activate/deactivate their possibilities through the Wogify Options menu, accessed from the scenario selection screen.

The scripts are as follows:

!!!! Script 00 - Wogify

This is the 'master script'. It gathers information from the wogify menu and activates the chosen scripts at the start of the game. It also changes some of the map's objects, creatures, resources, artifacts, etc. to different ones, so as you can play with other scripts' WoG features.

!!!! Script 01 - Map Rules

# Monsters are half price on 7th day of week.
# Heroes create magic plains each day.
# All monsters attack twice. 
# Monster stacks in hero armies grow by 4% each day, to 10000 max.
# Most dwellings also have boars.
# Heroes start at 5th level (+5000 experience).
# Heroes pick up double artifacts.
# Perpetual darkness.

Any hero who has this artifact equipped prior to a battle in which he or she is the *Attacker* will be given the opportunity to summon the Demon Lord Asmodeus to fight the battle instead. If the player is the defender in a combat, no option to summon Asmodeus will be given.

Asmodeus fights the battle (under the player's control) but with the hero's troops. He possesses good primary abilities (starting at 13) and knows useful secondary skills like Expert Wisdom, Expert Sorcery and Expert Fire Magic. He has several powerful fire spells at his disposal. If Asmodeus loses the battle, the hero is *not* lost, but will remain on the map with 3 lowly imps (a gift from Asmodeus). If Asmodeus *flees* the battle, the summoning hero will keep the remaining army. If Asmodeus wins the battle, the hero will not gain experience and will not get the artifacts of the hero beaten (Asmodeus may claim these instead). Asmodeus' primary abilities will ALL increase by 1 for each combat won. After the battle, Asmodeus takes part of the hero's soul as payment. This results in the hero losing 1 point of Power permanently. However, if the hero is down to only 1 Power, Asmodeus steals the Hourglass and sends three devils to attack the hero's soul instead.

!!!! Script 51 - Enhanced Commanders

 *note: skill and ability descriptions in commander screen will be inaccurate, please ignore them*

!!!! Script 53 - Dungeon of the Dragon Master

All Dragon Utopias on a map are now guarded by Darkness Dragons. If the "Hero's upgraded level 7 creatures become level 8" map rule is enabled, there will be 8..20, and if not enabled, 3..12.

* Limits additional Ballistas/First Aid Tents to two
* Ammo Cart gives +10 movement points per step
* All war machines cost 1000 gold

Heroes with Ballistics skill can:

* target creatures with catapults during normal combat
* field a number of catapults equal to their skill level
* have catapults inflict a death stare-like "critical hit" (chance = .5% x hero level x catapults)

!!!! Script 56 - Metamorphs

When enabled, Earth Messengers become Metamorphs. Metamorphs randomly transform themselves in combat into other monster types just prior to their first action. The new type is random but the Metamorph stack's total health will not exceed the total health of the creature they turn into. 

A Metamorph stack will also transform when it kills an enemy stack on its turn (but not if it kills the enemy stack with a retaliation attack). After combat, the remaining Metamorphs will change back into their normal Metamorph state. 

!!!! Script 57 - Neutral Units

Several enhancements for neutral units. they all can be individually activated/deactivated in the WoGify menu.

!!!!! *** Neutral Unit Bonuses

Adds +1 Attack, +1 Defense, plus an additional +1 Attack, +1 Defense, and +6-6.99% Health for every 4 game days. This results in approximately +2 Attack, +2 Defense and +10.5-12.25% Health every week, but note that the Health bonus only applies to creatures with a starting Health of 15 or higher (also, all units that will reach 15 health will receive approximately +2 Attack, +2 Defense and +10.5-12.25% Health every week; e.g.: centaurs, pikemen). 

Also gives Bless to all neutral units each week. In addition, neutral shooting units will be enchanted with Precision. 

The following neutral units will also be enchanted with Magic Mirror: Genies, Master Genies, Efreeti, Efreet Sultans, Ogre Magi and Santa Gremlins. 

The following neutral units will also be enchanted with Air Shield: Skeletons, Skeleton Warriors, Air Elementals, Storm Elementals, Wights, Wraiths, Ghosts, Bone Dragons and Ghost Dragons. 

The following neutral units will also be enchanted with Fire Shield: Fire Elementals, Energy Elementals, Firebirds and Phoenixes. 

The following neutral units will gain immunity to Mind spells: Angels, Archangels, Supreme Archangels, Devils, Arch Devils, Antichrists, Behemoths, Ancient Behemoths, Ghost Behemoths, Hydras, Chaos Hydras, Hell Hydras. 

The following neutral units will gain immunity to Fire school spells: Devils, Arch Devils, Antichrists. 

A "neutral unit" is defined as a monster stack on the map or any other unowned monster that you do battle with when visiting an adventure map site or neutral town. 

!!!!! *** Neutral Stack Size

All neutral monster stacks on the adventure map will be adjusted so that they contain more creatures. 

Starting with more creatures will also effectively result in them growing faster, although the actual weekly rate of growth remains unchanged.

Formula is:

* Level 1 Units: 30-50 +10% per week
* Level 2 Units: 30-40 +10% per week
* Level 3 Units: 30-50 +10% per week
* Level 4 Units: 50 + 10% per week
* Level 5 Units: +50 + 10% per week
* Level 6 Units: 50 + 10% per week
* Level 7 Units: 20-30 + 10% per week
* Level 8 Units: +20 + 10% per week

!!!!! *** Neutral Stack Experience

Neutral units will be experienced when you do combat with them. Their rank will depend on their level, the game date and the player difficulty level chosen. 

Level 1 and 2 neutral units will have one rank of experience for every week of game play at Normal game difficulty. Level 3-4 units will have one rank for every two weeks, level 5-6 will have one rank for every three weeks, and level 7+ will have one rank for every four weeks. 

Higher game difficulties will increase the rate. For example, at Impossible difficulty, a level 7 unit will have one rank for every 12 game days. 

Easy difficulty doubles the interval of Normal difficulty, so neutral units will gain ranks considerably slower. 

However, regardless of the game date or level, neutral units will never be more than 1 rank higher than the attacking hero's level. So a level 1 hero will never face anything higher than a rank 2 neutral unit in combat. 

A "neutral unit" is defined as a monster stack on the map or any other unowned monster that you do battle with when visiting an adventure map site. 

!!!!! *** Neutral Town and Creature Bank Growth 

Neutral Town Guards grow by 10% each week per stack (minimum +1), and gain higher level creatures if an empty guard slot is available. There's also a 10% chance per stack each week that a guard stack will be upgraded. 

Neutral Creature banks also grow by 10% each week per stack (minimum +1), and empty slots will be soon be filled with additional creatures. Creature Banks also acquire a Commander of the associated town type, and their resources grow at a rate of 10% every 3 weeks (minimum +1). 

After 28 days, a defeated Creature Bank will respawn, but beware--sometimes the creatures are more powerful than before (especially Dragon Utopias!).

!!!! Script 58 - Scouting III - Espionage

This option gives heroes who know the scouting skill the ability to train spies. Spies can then infiltrate enemy towns where they can fulfill different operations (thefts, sabotage, assassinations, status report), or they can be sent to the owner's towns to protect them from enemy spies (higher chance of enemy spies being exposed). Assignments depend on the level of scouting. Each hero can have only one spy at a time. Computer players cannot use spies.

To give commands to your operatives, right-click on the Scouting *icon* in the hero screen. 

!!!! Script 59 - Piercing Shot

This option changes the special ability of the Marksmen from "shooting twice" to "piercing shot". This shot does half damage to an enemy stack behind the targeted stack. In addition, Marksmen gain +1 attack, +1 defense, reduce their target's defense by 3+20%, and do 2-5 damage, however their shots is reduced to 12. An Air Shield spell on the primary target neutralizes the piercing bolt. 

Also, the name of Archers is changed to Crossbowmen and their ranged attack reduces the target's Defense by 10% (minimum reduction of 1).

!!!! Script 60 - Forgotten Shrine

When praying at the altar in the Forgotten Shrine, the hero's troops receive a random beneficial spell applied to all friendly stacks at expert level for 50 turns in the next battle (even non-group spells are applied to all). The hero's movement points are reduced to 0 after a visit. Every hero can have only one blessing at a time. 

If object replacement is selected, Forgotten Shrines may replace some of the following: Shrines of Magic Gesture, Shrines of Magic Thought and Idols of Fortune 

!!!! Script 61 - Enhanced Protection From the Elements

The Protection from Fire, Protection from Air, Protection from Water and Protection from Earth spells give protection against non-damage spells (like Slow, Curse, etc.). The chance of resisting such a spell depends on your proficiency at the element your troops are protected from (i.e., your Air, Earth, Fire or Water Magic skill level) 

* None - 20%
* Basic - 33%
* Advanced or Expert - 50%

Note: The protection works for non-group spells only.

!!!! Script 62 - Split Decision

During combat, an army commanded by a hero may split a stack into two stacks by ctrl-clicking on the active stack. Each stack may only be split once per combat. War Machines, Metamorphs and creatures that join a battle after it has started (e.g., summoned Elementals) cannot be split. After the battle, split stacks will recombine. 

You may also combine two adjacent stacks of the same type during combat by ctrl-clicking on the adjacent stack on the acting stack's turn. 

!!!! Script 63 - Passable Terrain

With this option enabled, mountains, trees, flowers and most other terrain can be moved through, but at a slower rate than normal movement. Pathfinding reduces the cost of moving through these terrain obstacles.

There are dangers, however. When moving through trees, you may be ambushed. When moving through mountains, you may lose troops to a deadly landslide. Skills such as Pathfinding, Scouting and Luck can help avoid landslides, and Scouting will sometimes let you spot an ambush in advance. 

In addition, to prevent heroes from sneaking up and grabbing treasures from monsters *too* easily, the monsters on the map will now attack if any treasure they're adjacent to is picked up, even if that wouldn't normally have triggered a combat. Treasures include treasure chests, resource piles, artifacts, and camp fires. 

WARNING: this option significantly changes the way Heroes plays so be prepared for a very different game. Take care where you move; the pathfinder will indicate the shortest route, even through trees and mountains, but doesn't know you'll be moving slower.

!!!! Script 64 - Scriptlets

Several small scripts that can be turned on/off individually in the WoGify menu. They mostly enhance certain elements. 

!!!!! *** Transfer Owner

Enables ownership transference of own heroes, towns, mines, dwellings, lighthouses, shipyards and garrisons to any active color, incl. none. 

Right-click on chat bar to activate/deactivate, then right-click on a flagged object you own. 

!!!!! *** Rampart Faerie Dragon

All Ramparts exchange their lvl 7 dragons for:

* 1 Faerie Dragon per week (instead of 2 Green Dragons)
* 1 Diamond Dragon per week (instead of 2 Gold Dragons) 

!!!!! *** Reduced Conflux Firebird/Phoenix Growth

If Castle and Pyre built, Conflux only produces 3 Firebirds/Phoenix per week (instead of 4).

Note 1: The bottom-left picture in the town screen will still indicate standard growth, as will the castle screen.

Note 2: If Enhanced Monsters is also active, this option will reduce Firebird/Phoenix Growth to only one per week.

!!!!! *** Advanced Witch Huts

Heroes can refuse the skill offer or get it advanced for 3000 gold or even forget that skill altogether. 

!!!!! *** Estates Enhanced II

Gives further 25/50/100 Gold per 10,000 experience each day (max +2000 gold/day, lvl 25) and gives out additional resources depending on skill expertise and hero level.

Lvl 10+ hero with Expert Estates might even choose resource type. Click on skill description *and* on skill icon in hero screen to get further details. 

!!!!! *** First Aid Enhanced II

The First Aid skill summons and gives control over additional First Aid Tents (# of tents = hero level). It also casts an automatic Cure spell each healing, based on First Aid Expertise and number of Tents.

First Aid Specialty temporarily gives hero knowledge of Cure, Animate Dead and Resurrection spells each battle. 

!!!!! *** Warfare (Artillery/Ballistics/First Aid)

Combines the three war machines skills Artillery, Ballistics and First Aid into a single "Warfare" skill.

Gives hero control over all three war machines and standard SoD abilities from all three skills. Advancing one skill will advance the others.

Careful: will become insanely powerful if you simultaneously use other WoGify enhancements for those skills.

!!!! Script 65 - Monolith Toll

Normally with two-way liths there is no cost for quite high reward: to be able to visit many areas of the map and gain access to non-guarded items and map locations. It seems to make sense to have some sort of cost for using two-way liths, even if not extravagant. One-way liths will continue to be free, as they are not susceptible to being used over and over again like two-way liths are. 

The cost to use a two-way lith is 100 gold per week for human players and 50 gold per week for AI players, but if the AI has no gold, it will still be able to use the lith.

!!!! Script 66 - Commander Witch Huts

Witch Huts will give bonus skills and abilities to Commanders as well as to the Hero. 

!!!! Script 67 - Neutral Town

Conflux Town troops are replaced with a selection of neutral creatures. Also, Conflux Heroes will have low-level neutral troops instead of regular Conflux troops and the might Conflux Heroes have new specialties.

Neutral Town Troops:

* Level 1 non-upgraded: Halflings
* Level 1 upgraded: Rogues
* Level 2 non-upgraded: Boars
* Level 2 upgraded: Nomads
* Level 3 non-upgraded: Fire Messengers
* Level 3 upgraded: Air Messengers
* Level 4 non-upgraded: Werewolves
* Level 4 upgraded: Trolls
* Level 5 non-upgraded: Sorceresses
* Level 5 upgraded: Enchanters
* Level 6 non-upgraded: Hell Steeds
* Level 6 upgraded: Nightmares
* Level 7 non-upgraded: Gorynyches
* Level 7 upgraded: Rust Dragons

Note: creature growth and costs of some of the Neutral Town creatures have been adjusted to better fit their new levels. Fire and Air Messengers have adjusted stats and gain the double-strike ability. Air Messengers can also fly.

!!!! Script 68 - New Battlefields

New Battleground pictures will often be used in combat. This has no affect on the battles but adds some visual variety. 

Note: new PCX files are required for this script. If you have the script but not the graphics, you won't see new battlefields.

!!!! Script 69 - Custom Alliances

You may set custom alliances before the first turn.

!!!! Script 70 - Death Chamber

Death Chambers are a new type of creature bank where you must fight the Undead King and his minions. 

If object replacement is selected, Death Chambers may replace some of the following: Level 1 Magic Shrines, Learning Stones, Witch Huts, Windmills

+1 to +5 Primary Stat bonus (1, 2, or all 4 stats depending on artifact type).

Add one rank to a random secondary skill (if this puts you at expert, the bonus is permanent).

!!!! Script 72 - Random Hero

There is a 25% chance that a random hero will appear on the monsters' side and help them fight. If the Enhanced War Machines III script is enabled, the number of war machines of the random hero depends on the strength of the monsters.

!!!! Script 73 - Enhanced War Machines III

Every hero can carry more than one war machine. War machines can be obtained from towns and war machine factories. With the first aid tent the player can resurrect creatures if their stack on the battlefield is not completely killed. The ammo cart gives spell points each round equal to the number of ammo carts the hero owns.

!!!! Script 74 - Summon Elementals

Heroes can summon elementals permanently for their army (when not in combat) if the hero knows the corresponding spell and has enough spell points to cast the spell. The spell points required for spell casting is ten times more than it would be on the battlefield, but the number of elementals remains the same. Summoning is allowed only once per day. 

To summon elementals permanently in the adventure screen, select the hero and right-click on the Spell Book icon.

!!!! Script 75 - Abbreviated Skill Descriptions

Abbreviated skill descriptions will be displayed when right-clicking on secondary skills. 

This option is for players who prefer to view abbreviated descriptions instead of the standard Heroes 3 paragraph-format descriptions. It's especially useful if you have multiple skill enhancements enabled; the standard paragraph text can be quite long and cumbersome.

!!!! Script 76 - Commander Sanctuary

The Sanctuary will revive a dead Commander for a small resource donation. 

If object replacement is selected, Sanctuaries may replace some of the following: Imp Caches, Griffin Conservatories, Rally Flags, Prisons, Marletto Towers

!!! Additional Objects

The game now includes a set of additional objects which do not have any built-in function but can be programmed by the map-maker through ERM scripting to be whatever he or she wants them to be. Of course, even without scripting, these objects can be used for decorative purposes on any map. You can find the majority of such objects in the castle objects section in the WoG map editor. ERM scripts for these and other objects can be specially developed for a given map or pre-made scripts can be used, such as the ones which can be found on the WoG web site.
