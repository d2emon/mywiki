!! Board - Western
		
Computer versions of board/parlor games that are popular in the West, such as Chess, Checkers, and Backgammon (yes, Chess was invented in the Orient but it's much more popular in the Western hemisphere now). These games require the player to play against an opponent, either the computer or another human player. They can be either traditional games, or original titles that were invented in the West (e.g. Terrace and MetaSquarer). This category includes only abstract board games - for PC games based on tabletop or "designers" board games (such as Settlers of Catan or Advanced Civilization), check out the Tabletop strategy subgenre instead.
