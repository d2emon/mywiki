!! Real-time strategy
		
Commonly referred to as "RTS," real-time strategy is one of the most popular subgenres today, thanks to the popularity of Westwood's Dune 2 and Blizzard's WarCraft. For turn-based titles that are based on the same scale (i.e. usually tactical), check out the Squad-level subgenre instead.
