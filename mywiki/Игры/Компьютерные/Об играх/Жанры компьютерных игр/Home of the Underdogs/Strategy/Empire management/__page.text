!! Empire management

Perhaps the most generic of all strategy subgenres, empire management games put the player in control of an empire-- and the objective is to manage it well to accomplish a given objective. Unlike 4X on Earth games, empire management games do not focus on exploration or research, and they do not have a fog of war. And unlike God game/micromanagement games, they do not require micromanagement (e.g. assigning different jobs to workers, etc.). This subgenre is best thought of as "light" wargames: they include non-military elements such as diplomacy and economics as integral parts of gameplay.
