01.)                         INTRODUCTION                  G0100
==============================================================================

Welcome to 'Planet of Lust' for the PC, a text adventure by Free Spirit
Software released in 1989.

The game features some lousy grammar and spelling at times, don't think I made
those typos by mistake but I did try to correct some of it as well as fix
punctuation.

Suggestions, comments or errors - email me about it. Enjoy!


==============================================================================
02.)                         OVERVIEW & CONTROLS           G0200
==============================================================================

The game uses the direction keys to move around. PageUp/Down is for scrolling
through messages. If the icons are lit up on the right site it means you are
able to read more/move in that direction. You can either move in that
direction or type N, E, W, S respectively.

The parser is very, very basic, so type things exactly as written in CAPITAL
letters. In the game, you can use lower caps though, no problem. "|" means OR
in case you were wondering.

Ctrl+I shows the inventory.
Ctrl+L gives you the location info.
Ctrl+S for Sandie's hints.

START restarts the game from the beginning.
QUIT to end the game.
HELP for "help".

KILL ME commits suicide in case you want to.

You cannot save or load the game. If you get stuck or die you need to restart
from the beginning.


==============================================================================
03.)                         WALKTHROUGH                   G0300
==============================================================================

You are Captain Brad Stallion owner and operator of the one man space vehicle
known through the galaxy as ...

                  |================|
                  |  Big Thruster  |
                  |================|

Again, the Federated Planets have called on your to perform another critical
mission... Space World Erotica is the top Pleasure Planet in the Galaxy. Due
the unique molecular structure of the planet's rain, it has the properties of
a powerful aphrodisiac. The planet is filled with a billion pleasure seeking
vacationers. The entire planet is being held hostage by the mad scientist
Doctor Dildo. He has surrounded the atmosphere with a force-field. If the
Federated Planets does not hand over its ultimate weapon (the Mind-Imprinter)
Doctor Dildo will increase the power of the force field and... CRUSH THE
PLANET!

Destroy the force field projector before Erotica is no more!

Finally! ....
=============================

Lust rises within you as she presses her warm flesh near yours. The heat of
passion consumes you as two bodies become one ... The aroma of exotic perfume
& love making fill the air. Both your cries echo throughout the cave and into
the jungle in thundering climax. Covered in sweat, you lie exhausted next to
her.

>TALK | ASK | QUESTION

'I know why you are here. You will need water from the Pool of Everlasting

==============================================================================
04.)                         ALTERNATIVE ENDING?           G0400
==============================================================================

After you have made love with Princess Orgasma you can possible ask her to
lead you to the control room.

>ASK |TALK | QUESTION

=============================
Follow me to the Control Room
=============================

=============================
You follow her thru hallways.
=============================

'I see you have arrived Mr. Stallion. Too bad you will be leaving us soon'
Dildo sneers.


>PUNCH

With a single blow of your manly fist you knock the villain unconscious.

>GRAB LEVER

As you release the force field from Erotica a rumble is felt throughout the
Space Station.


At this point you are faced with many possibilities, but none seem to lead to
a successful escape. Not only does this seem the more plausible solve to the
situation, but the program has several lines of code describing more events to
follow. For example you are on Big Thruster with the Princess, and then after
you sit down the station rumbles even more. I would assume you simply blast
off to the planet for the vacation and the station explodes. This isn't
described in the code, so it is possible this was all dropped from the actual
game instead of a simple "leave" solution. 

Other code that seems interesting is that Doctor Dildo asks you for the Mind
weapon. Also Sandie points you into the direction of hitting Dr. Dildo, and
lying about the weapon. I guess it's really just unused code, but this ending
seems to dumb I figure it's not the real one...

YY.)                         REVIEW                        GYY00
==============================================================================

Gameplay:  1/10

The parser is too basic and mainly accepts just one input for a command. If
you don't know it, you can guess around for a long time. Dying or getting
stuck means starting over from the beginning, no loading. The game is short
but the frustration kicks in quickly. The puzzles in this one are even worse
than the first game, the ending doesn't even make sense. Trying to end the
game a la James Bond fails, which would be logical way to save the galaxy,
right? How lame they can't even put a decent story in motion, and the
locations are well boring this time. Seeing that the only place you can
explore is the planet surface full of jungle and a dark cave, there isn't much
else to do around here. With a walkthrough you could possible finish this in 5
minutes.


Graphics:  2/10

Whereas the first game was acceptable to have some attempt of EGA graphics,
this one is utter garbage. Most screens are recycled and the jungle for one
is one massive clutter of colors and pallets. Perhaps there is something wrong
on today's hardware, but I'll blame the game for this one easily.


Sound:  n/a

No sound again, just like in the first game. I guess we should be thankful for
that.

 
Overall:  1/10

Avoid, or play if you must see some ugly pixel nudity but I doubt it was worth
your time and effort. Fortunately for PC users, the sequel 'Bride of the
Robot' was only released on the Amiga and Atari-ST.
