Bunnies & Burrows (B&B) is a role-playing game (RPG) based upon the novel Watership Down, which is about a group of talking rabbits seeking a new warren.

!!! History

Originally published by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1976 only two years after the first RPG (D&D) was published, this edition is now long out of print. The art, illustrated by Charles Loving, was sketchy and of poor quality, and the entire manuscript appeared to have been typewritten. This was common for the time the book was published. A second edition was printed in 1982.

Bunnies & Burrows was the first RPG to allow for non-humanoid play. In addition, it was also the first RPG to have detailed martial arts rules (known as "Bun Fu") and the first attempt at a skill system. While it has been far surpassed by advances in RPG mechanics in the past thirty years, at the time of its creation it was revolutionary. Finally, it is the first RPG to appeal equally to women as well as men.

During a rise of "retro" games in the early 1990s, Steve Jackson Games licensed the setting of Bunnies & Burrows for adaptation to the GURPS rule set. Steffan O'Sullivan wrote GURPS Bunnies & Burrows with interior art by Jim Groat. It was published in 1992. The book is now out of print, but is still available via digital download.

In 2004, the setting was again converted to be used in Risus: The Anything RPG by S. John Ross through Cumberland Games & Diversions.

!!! Gameplay

While the player characters interact with many different animal species there is only one monster race - humans, whose thought processes and motivations are completely alien. B&B also had the advantage of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictive. For example, a person playing a rabbit, when told that his character is confronted with a fox, has an immediate intuition on the amount of peril he or she is facing. Because player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game is also notable for being one of the first to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them. The system was created for the game, as was common for the time it was published. It features eight abilities and eight classes. The task resolution system was largely percentile based.
