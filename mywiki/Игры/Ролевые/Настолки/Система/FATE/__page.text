FATE, Fantastic Adventures in Tabletop Entertainment, is a generic role-playing game system based on the FUDGE gaming system. It has no fixed setting, traits, or genre and is almost entirely customizable. However, it is designed to offer the least possible obstruction to role-playing by assuming that players do not want to make large amounts of dice rolls.

Fate was written by Fred Hicks and Rob Donoghue. FATE gained a large number of adherents both for its high level of support, which is unusual for a free game, and for the numerous innovative gaming mechanics.

!!! Differences between FUDGE and FATE

While FATE uses FUDGE's verbal scale and four three-sided dice, it breaks from practically every other role-playing game by doing away with mandatory traits such as Strength and Intelligence, and substantially reworking the "experience point" mechanic. It instead assumes that every character is "average" and allows exceptional abilities to be defined through an Aspect system. A player may choose, for example, to take an Aspect in Brawny (or Muscle Man or Wiry Strength) and choose to spend Aspects to gain a temporary bonus in a relevant situation. Aspects may also be taken in possessions, e.g. the character Indiana Jones for example, might have the Aspect "Whip and Fedora". The fact that Aspects can be anything integral to the character allows for a degree of melding of mechanics and role-playing difficult in most other gaming systems.

Aspects are an important and original concept in FATE. They are not intrinsically good or bad; they are simply descriptive, up to the level of detail the player requires. In addition to the obvious direct character help in most cases, the FATE system also provides a mechanism to reward the characters when one of their Aspects has restricted their choices or landed them in some trouble.

!!! FATE OGL resources

While there has been concern that FUDGE would restrict its "open" license and thus force FATE to change to a different underlying mechanic, such fears have subsided once FUDGE itself was released under the Open Gaming License. FATE has an associated Yahoo! Group to discuss the gaming system and share settings and conversions of other role-playing games.

!!! Fate 3rd Edition

A 3rd edition of FATE is currently in development, and is the basis for Evil Hat's Spirit of the Century as well as the upcoming The Dresden Files role-playing game. Evil Hat has stated that a free PDF of FATE 3rd Edition will be released after the Dresden Files RPG is completed. The System Reference Document for FATE 3E is currently available.
