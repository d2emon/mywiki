# Подставить под ограбление
# Клад-музыканты
# Груз динамита
   
# A pirate captain has a reputation for both ruthlessness and incredible compassion. He’s a devout man of faith and believes that all evil actions must be balanced by equally good actions. No one ever knows if he’s in the process of balancing the scales by doing good deeds or if he’s back to even and looking to wreak havoc, while he overtakes another ship, kills the crew and steals the treasure. It’s unfortunate that the PCs are about to have a run-in with him.
# While on deck the PCs are witness to a heated lover’s quarrel between two rich nobles. The man storms off only to return with a small chest which he throws overboard. The woman is stunned and berates the man for throwing something so valuable overboard. One of the PCs recognizes the item the woman named and realized that it’s actually a powerful magic relic and not just a pretty bauble. If the PCs ever want to recover it they have to act now. Finding this exact spot later will be impossible.
# During a game of chance one of the PCs wins a ship from a pirate captain. When the PCs board the ship and inform the crew they are unfazed and agree to stay on. They explain that this isn’t the first time their captain’s lost the ship. But every time he does the new captain returns the ship in short order. They have no doubt it will be the same this time and welcome the PCs aboard.[[<<]][The ship is haunted by the ghosts of the original crew. They torment and attack anyone onboard not wearing a special wooden ring carved from the ship’s original mast.]
# The PCs are at sea when the ship is damaged beyond repair (monster attack, random accident, lightning strike, etc.). It will sink in short order. With limited space in the lifeboats and land days away there is a frenzy to get a seat. Some people even argue that their material possessions are more valuable than some lives. The captain promises death to anyone using force to secure a seat. He is an exceptionally skilled swordsman and has an entourage of fanatically loyal crew that will back him if necessary. He insists that everyone plead their case and majority will decide who, and what, gets on the lifeboats.
# The ship’s crew was recently in two battles that looked like sure defeat only to emerge victorious thanks to the actions of a PC. The crew now believes that the PCs is their good luck charm. Fortune continues to smile on the ship and the crew as they avoid a natural disaster and find lost treasure. The PC is treated like royalty – until things start to go bad. It doesn’t take long before the crew thinks the same PC is now the cause of their bad luck and want him off the ship immediately. They don’t care that they’re at sea, he can swim home.
# The PCs are among the pirate crew searching for lost treasure. When they find the buried treasure the chest is full of gold coins. However, the markings on the coins are unfamiliar. When deciphered the writing indicates they were minted in an island nation that is believed to only exist in a children’s bedtime story. Could it really exist?
# The PCs hear that a notorious pirate captain they’ve had successful and profitable dealings with in the past is in port. When they go to pay him a visit the man who introduces himself as the notorious pirate captain is not the man they dealt with previously and has no idea who the PCs are. It’s definitely the same ship (albeit a different crew) and the name is right, but nothing else. Is this man an impostor or was the original captain?[[<<]][He’s the Dread Pirate Roberts. Hopefully that clears things up for the DM. If not, see The Princess Bride.]
# While in the crow’s nest one of the PCs sees a small island. When he calls for others to look in that direction the island seems to disappear. The only time this PC sees it is when no one else is looking for it. The crew mocks the PC and share the tale of a “chosen one” who will one day find the fabled lost island. Could the PC be the chosen one?[[<<]][The island could be real, but if a DM wants to have a little fun he can have the crew in on the joke. The ship’s Wizard casts an illusion whenever that PC is on lookout and when he calls out the rest of the crew pretend not to see anything. One or two of the PCs might even be in on the joke. The chosen one will be known because he passes three tests. Have fun and make the tests as outrageous, disgusting or hilarious as you see fit.]

!!! ARRR!? (=ADVENTURE IDEAS FOR PIRATE RPG GROUP?)

We have recently started a pirates campaign in one of my gaming groups. We use a modified Cyberpunk 2020 system - which basically means it's pretty simple, really good for action but quite deadly. The setting is very much "Pirates Of The Caribbean", meaning we use the historical places in the "Golden Age" Caribbean, fractions, trade routes, but pump up the whole power level to "Hollywood". Magic, mystical creatures (giant kraken, merfolk, ...) and stuff like that is real.

What has happened so far:

All characters were marooned on the same island where they met, build a watercraft and escaped to one of the main shipping routes. They got picked up by a British trade ship and have now arrived in Port Royal. There they have signed on a small "trading" vessel which has pretty much already turned out to be a smuggler ship and is about to leave in two days.

The characters:

* A former British officer who switched sides and became a pirate. He is pretty much the man most hated by the British navy. He is the reason they want to get out of Port Royal asap.
* A Danish nobleman of questionable character.
* A ship's boy who is searching for his father... and is actually a girl.
* A former cannoneer who was killed in a voodoo ritual to revive the evil captain's evil son. Instead, he took possession of the son's body and killed the captain. So now, part of the crew wants to kill him because he has killed the captain, others think he actually is the son and want a piece of him because of that...

So, any ideas what to do with the group?  It's not that I don't have any but more would be nice.

-----

Having an unexpected ship inspection seems appropriate, if a little obvious. Someone spots the former officer and reports the sighting, the other three seem like just the right people to help him out.

How about:
an encounter with a Viking ghost longship from the time of the Vinland sagas
Barbary Corsairs being chased by some unknown creature of the deep
A scholar of classical literature (and mythology) is search for either Poseidon/Neptune's chariot and/or the 'sea horses' that pull it.
they meet an Irish born sailor/pirate who carries the spirit of his/her ancestor, the Sea Queen; Grace O'Malley.
A Japanese ronin turned pirate that uses a special object (a katana or other) that calls upon the Kamikaze storm to devastate pursuing ships.
getting lost in a thick fog, the ship runs aground. They have come to an island that is not charted on any map. They meet a crazed old man, wearing a rob of seaweed; he has no idea how long he has been on the island; or how to get off it.
a shadowy agent of the Dutch East India Company is searching major Caribbean ports, looking for someone or something in particular. Why is he in the West Indies in the first place?
I hope you find some use for these ideas.

I wrote a pirate short story with the idea that the pirates got captured. After being locked up for a while the kingdom that was holding them gave the pirates a chance to win their freedom. All small group of them would aid in a rescue mission, while the rest of the crew remained locked up. If the group succeeded in the rescue mission then the whole crew would get released and receive full pardons for that kingdom. I don't know if this idea could work in a game or not.

A suspicious mermerchant has some loot for sale, which he's salvaged from sunken ships.
A parrot, appropriately named Polly, knows the location of his late masters' buried treasure, but won't take you to it (or stop repeating rude and insulting phrases) until his demands are met. Polly want a cracker.
A rum merchant's daughter has been captured by cannibals whilst on a pleasure cruise. As he has promised many bottles of the good stuff as a reward for her safe return, it's a mission well worth taking.

Personly I'd suggest to keep the fantasy stuff light so it has more impact when it happens. Pirates of the carribean 1 did it good, part 2 and 3 went too far with it. Never saw part 4 so cant comment on that.. 

I'd suggest going with some classic pirate scenarios: 

-searching a lost treasure. What it is is up for grasps.. maybe fountain of youth, Spanish gold or a specific highy valueable object. 

-Looting a town thats not nearly as defenceless as it first looked. 
Can go wrong in so many ways. 

-Possibly mutiny. 
Can be an interesting situation to deal with, tension seems to be rising.

I don’t fully know what kind of world you want, or what is already in it. I just happen to know of a new pirate role playing that is different (keyword different), and maybe (keyword maybe) it would something you like. Or maybe it would fit at with what you wanting to do. It’s called Pirates & Dragons. I’m serious. It’s apparently pirate game, with dragons. Here is a link to their official website.

Wow, thank you for all the responses. I'll do this torontogal style. 

As a side note: Thanks to my amazing players, I obviously have a lot of plot hooks right there in 
the group. I think it's worth a mention that nobody got any points or 
special advantages for including these things into their back stories - 
expect for the undead cannoneer who got a bunch of advantages and 
disadvantages for being undead.

@Zuffy: My initial plot for Port Royal is a lot like what you wrote. The PCs arrival was reported to the authorities there and a lot of people will be interested in talking to them - be it because of suspicion or simple curiosity- but the news takes a little time to travel and since they left the harbor master's offices pretty fast, they dodged all of that so far. Until now, only two or three NPCs had the chance to roll if they recognize "Red Jack", as the former officer is known, from the wanted posters. He as grown a beard over the last two weeks and got rid of the clothes he usually wears, so it wasn't easy.
Being recognized in Port Royal would surely lead to the imprisonment of the whole group and a death penalty (at least) for Red Jack, so they would have to escape. - But if they keep dressing up and hiding so well while telling their pretty consistent story and not messing up any of the rolls whole doing so... they could get out of here without being caught.

That ties nicely into your idea, @BingoBard. My idea for when they are imprisoned, was directly ripped out of "Pirates of the Caribbean 1". In jail, they would meet a pirate with a compass that does not point towards north and who has an escape plan that requires some help. 
I honestly like your idea better but I will need some NPCs the characters care about to keep as hostages. If the group + crew is captured by the British, they would probably not offer such a deal but the person offering it could be some shady figure who will be able to break them out with a fake pardon - which will later be discovered as fake to restore the status quo. I will look into the system you linked there, thank you!

@Ueltomas: I really like all of these ideas, especially the one with the parrot. 

@Rhalius: You are absolutely right with the supernatural stuff. Since I do have an undead character who knows a bunch about voodoo in the group, I really have to keep it on reasonable levels to not overdo it.
The group was chased by a giant kraken on their way to the main shipping lane but got away from it due to really great rolls for sailing. That's about all the fantasy/supernatural stuff that has happened adventure wise so far and I intend to not base anything on supernatural events right away.

The thing about this campaign, as with most of my campaigns, is that the world is completely free. I have not planed a whole lot and while the group and I have talked about our general expectations, everyone is aware that this is a big sandbox and that we will make stuff up while we go along.

If the character get out of Port Royal without getting captured and on the ship they have signed on to, they will probably have to deal with at least one inspection by the Spanish navy and one pirate attack. I had also thought about a storm or dense fog that results in the ship getting stranded and the PCs having to recruit a native tribe that lives on a nearby island to help them.
The PCs know by now that the Nikoletta (that's the name of the ship) 
will take a course North to the Bahamas and that is was guarded by lobsters 
(British soldiers) in Port Royal. What they don't know yet, is that they are transporting a big load of bribes to present to the pirate chieftrain of Nassau. That's pretty much all I have so far. 
If you see any spam, @-mention me in the thread and I will come in to kill it with my hammer. The hammer is not my... you know.

It's nice to have the options open with supernatural stuff yes, but it can be a lot of fun to have stuff hidden. Like an NPC not being all what they first seem to be. Maybe there could even be a necromancer or witch of sorts who could try and charm the undead cannoneer? 

Maybe the kid could have some interaction with other kids? maybe a possible informant who wouldnt trust the adults but would talk to the kid. 

Maybe the danish nobleman's past could come to haunt him? maybe a dept he didnt pay, another noble family he wronged in the past? 

As for the brittish officer, aside from being hated by the redcoats I'd bet some pirates may hate him just as much for being responsible for the deaths of friends and loved ones before he switched sides.

@Daniel_Wallace Well something to consider is that during that era of piracy there was also what was called privateers. Privateers were very much like pirates. To current understanding the only difference between a pirate and privateer is a loyalty to a particular nation. Say for example I became a privateer for France. As a French privateer I could freely attack ships that were consider the enemy of France but legally would have to leave French ships and French allied ships alone. As long as I stay true to that agreement and provide France a share my loot than France will stay my friend and allow to freely dock in any France controlled harbor without fear of being arrested by the French government. So when talking about the idea of the pardon a question you can ask do you want make this pirate loyal to a particular nation, and if so which nation. Because after getting pardon from that nation could possibly become privateers for that nation. But of course that is total up to you. I’m just sharing my thoughts and ideas, because I generally just like sharing thoughts and ideas.

@BingoBard Yup, I know. That's pretty much what I figured why the British were going to bribe the pirates in Nassau - to convince them to provide another save haven for their privateers directly at the Spanish shipping line to Havana. I was just missing the term and got a little in a hurry when I made my last post. 

I am very sure Britain would not offer becoming privateer to someone with affiliations to Red Jack. He has humiliated them way too much. One thing I forgot to mention: He continued to wear his red jacket, without the insignia, as a pirate. Hence the name...

The Netherlands used plenty of privateers, the West Indian Company practicly where pirates. They where either robbing other ships or transporting slaves. 

Might be a good nation to be a privateer for too due to tensions with england depending on what kind of time its set.. Around 1700 the dutch Stadtholder Willem III van Oranje Nassau took the english crown so there wouldnt be any of that going on the period after that obviously, but they have had three wars before then and the Dutch navy was bigger than the British one too, though was neglected once the english crown was taken, and thus never was able to surpass england again. 

They wherent too present in the carribean though since the Dutch where mostly just trading and raiding there and not colonising.

How about:

everybody dies.
(In my head, the game's fantasy elements were introduced by George R R Martin.)

On a serious note, this campaign/world sounds really cool - and this coming from someone who doesn't actually like any of the Pirates of the Caribbean films - and makes me miss my RPG group from back home. So I want to thank Dan and everybody else for sharing their ideas, it's been really fun to read and flesh out some of these stories in my own head.

Could also include a unique appearance of the doomed Scottish colony of Panama, if the game is set between 1698-1700. The Company of Scotland might want privateers to defend their fledgling venture, or bring them supplies. Also an excuse to over-roleplay stereotypical Scots.

@Rhalius & @Niall_Rixon: Since the game is not set in the real world, I can (and will) throw together everything I like from history in any way that suits the game. 

@Rusty: It's always funny to me, how sometimes the really shitty movie/book/tv/... settings actually make for really nice RPG worlds. I do like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies but not as a whole.
They all have certain elements I think are really, really cool and going from there, I can fill in the gaps in a way I like.
Thinking about it, I guess that is true for a lot of genre fiction works. If you take out the (possibly annoying) characters and the (possibly stupid) story, you often end up with a really cool world.
That could also be why RPGs derived from great works of fiction often end up sucking - if you take out brilliant characters and amazing story, well, you could end up with an in itself kinda boring world that is filled with your own group's mediocre ideas.

@Daniel_Wallace I will admit considering the details with Red Jack would make it harder for Britain to offer the crew a pardon. But I also would say it’s impossible. Depending on who needs to be rescued and how desperate is the kingdom to have the person rescue you might be able to come with justifiable reason for Britain to offer Red Jack pardon. But like I said I can seeing that being something a bit more challenge. (Note: I currently don’t know how to pull off. I just think it could theoretically be possible.) If that is direction you want to look into, and you manage find a way to pull it off you can then also have some NPC are very displeased that Red Jack got a pardon. Perhaps a few NPCs in government positions or the navy will reappear, because when something goes Red Jack is the first person then tend to suspect, and in those case you write an adventure of Red Jack try to prove he is innocent of whatever it is his being accused of this time. Those ideas that swimming around my head, and I’m currently not sure how to pull them off.

@Rhalius: 100% agreed.

@BingoBard: Thanks for the input! I actually like to think about things like that but keep them a little "fuzzy" in my head on purpose. That way it's easier to react spontaneous without restricting oneself while being somewhat prepared at the same time.

I should maybe make a video about that very topic...

You could also throw the love card out there.  Have a certain city's governor's daughter fall in love with swashbuckling character (ala pirates of the Caribbean) or reversed, have a character smitten with lord so and so's daughter and will do anything to garner her attention.  This would draw the ire of the governor of course, but could also be used by an enemy of the governor and help out the character.  Just an idea. Sounds like quite a fun campaign.

Continueing with that, this governor's daughter could turn out to be rather freaky after first appearing to be quite a catch.

@Gridlandsfan: Thanks, it has been a lot of fun so far.

For the love story: While it surely is a nice idea, I am a little hesitant to throw this upon one of the characters without talking the outline through with the player beforehand. That said, I think I could interest the player of the Danish nobleman in a personal story like this... 

----
----

Well given the collection of awesome you already have above, it seems unnecessary of me to add of my own clumsy thoughts. But... I do so like to make long rambling posts 

First up, in view of the multinational nature of the group, you can have a lot of fun with wars. I would bring a British-Danish conflict into the background early on, and just let it simmer for a while. At least until the Danish nobleman is approached by relatives/relations asking him to facilitate a meeting with the former British officer, for the express purpose of obtaining intelligence into the British Fleet - this could be anything for tactical insight into various captains, to specific details of the defenses of one of his former postings.

Will Red Jack elect to betray his homeland? And what are the Danes offering for the information - to the group, to the Brit and especially to the nobleman - redemption for something in his shady past perhaps?. Also if Red Jack refuses to play ball, will the Danes accept that reply or simply attempt to take the information by force? Furthermore what happens if the British gain knowledge of the approach? Given Red Jack's reputation it seems likely they would instantly assume the worst. This could potentially lead to the party being hunted by not one but two warships they are unable to defeat in battle. Of course if they could somehow lure them into fighting each other, then there might be some easy loot in the aftermath 

Turtle Isle. Either have the party bury some of its treasure (its traditional), or hear tales of a long lost buried treasure (Map!). When the party returns to collect its booty (or loot someone else's) they find the island completely gone. Left in its place however is a small smattering of debris. Following the trail (sea tracking skills for the win) they find the island in a entirely different location. Of course as you may have guessed from the first sentence, the island if mounted atop a huge prehistoric turtle, and the debris was the remains of the building destroyed when it recently awoke from its thousand year slumber and dived.

Do the party risk retrieving there loot, and what happens when it decides to dive during the process? What strange parasitic creatures might live on the back of a titan sized turtle, and why exactly did it wake up now? Oh and how valuable would the island be if you could find some way of controlling the turtle? A mobile base would be a great way of avoiding capture.

Another option that springs to mind for any "villain" type group is to have them framed for an even more violent crime. The party initially find themselves being pursued by the authorities with even more vigor than usual, and finally discover that there being hunted for the massacre of an entire settlement. (I'm assuming your group is more the noble swashbuckling type of pirates, then the psychotic killer type.) The party must not only avoid intense pursuit, but track down the real villain and find evidence exonerating themselves. But the really fun part comes when the group falls into the hands of the authorities, and upon managing to prove themselves innocent - likely exposing some corrupt powerful official in the process - they are rewarded by being "hung for piracy, instead of tortured and quartered for mass homicide." Yay its prison break time. (Possibly aided by the corrupt official who initially framed them, and if now incarcerated alongside them!!) 

Also I assume you already have plans in place for the party to encounter the infamous pirate hunting vessel known only as the Owl, and its jovial Russian captain often referred to in the business as the Bear.

@alanalmeria: I'll ofter rather read some rambling from you then a worked out post from some others. 

I'm pretty sure the love for their nations are not too big for most of the characters, but I will keep your idea in mind and maybe mix it up with the romance story idea @gridlandsfan had... love and country vs. loyalty amongst pirates/friends... that could become interesting. Since it is the time for using privateers, intrigues and trade as weapons instead of armies and warships anyways, a smaller and more hidden conflict would probably be more interesting then a big war. It also offers more chances for "musketeer" like plots. Okay, I will not clean this post up - you are witnessing how plots come into existence in my mind. 

Right now I am thinking about the good old story of the (Danish) lady's maid who has contacted the characters before to do stuff for her mistress and who has something cooking with her countryman in the group.
At the same time, the group will have met a "secret agent" who works for the Brits, possibly a Scott named "Sean" who they have met during the unfortunate events in Panama.
Those two NPCs interests will collide when the maid needs the group to bring her mistresses jewelry back before the big ball where her husband wants to see them on her (you know the story...). At the same time, Sean will offer Red Jack a pardon from the Brits if he prevents the very same thing... muhaha. 


I also love the Turtle Island idea.

Something just popped into my head. All your pirate myths, legends, and stories about seafarer adventures. To my knowledge no one has ever written a pirate story that crosses path with Atlantis. You can either do things with Atlantis being under water and inhabited by people with some kind of submarine technology (thus providing a means to encounter the pirates). Or you can make it that Atlantis didn’t sink in your world. That they are an independent island nation of some kind. Or merging with @alanalmeria’s idea Atlantis could be on the back of the giant turtle which is why people mistakenly believe it sank because it keeps moving around. If you want to go with the idea that Atlantis is actually a moving island of some kind you can have Atlantis people have some kind of device (could be magical or otherwise) that manages to always guide them back to where Atlantis is no matter where it moves to.

Egad I think I actually want to try writing an Atlantis pirate story at some point.
