* Ха! Смотрите, парни, эта лошадь обосралась! Похоже на кусок гнилого мяса? А что такое лошадь-зомби?
* В этом храме не может быть ловушек.
* Ща, погодите, я проверю его карманы.
* Лично я возражаю против оживления Вернона! Да, у нас денег даже на жратву не останется. Вот заработаем еще - тогда и будем думать. Еще причины? Он слишком непредсказуем и злобен, пусть одумается пока. Как это Сенока в меня копьем тычет? Так и попасть можно. Ай, ты что, дурак? У нас же денег только на один ресуррект...
* Шорохи за спиной? Мало ли мышей в данжонах... Да отстаньте от меня, не буду я тратить свой последний True Seeing, неизвестно когда еще поспать придется...
* Притворяюсь кучкой дерьма под елкой.
* Кларк! Прикрой меня своей мясорубкой, я скастую! Кларк? Что, уже умер? Навох! Тоже не может говорить? Есив! Покурить вышел? Вернон, Нукл, Сенока, вы тут? Как за пивом данжон мастеру?
* Так не честно! Если рэйнджеры начнут мстить за каждого хомячка...
* Мы ложимся спать. В дозоре остается наш новый наемник.
* Смотрите! Этот паладин спит. Давайте прирежем его и продадим тело в орден.
* Эти тупые гномьи воры даже в тенях спрятаться толком не умеют.
* Белый дракон не может меня тронуть. Золотой же не напал.
* Человек, у которого на половине тела даже плоти нет, не может быть особо крутым.
* Это не справедливо! Почему Нукл весь обвешан артефактами, и меч вампирский +4 есть, которым он даже пользоваться не может, а у меня, порядочного паладина, какой-то кал: даже двуручник без плюсов. Ну и что, что он щипач первосортный? Дай мне этих мобов, с которых он поднял барахло, я их на бой вызываю. — (ДМ) Даю.
* Большая птица горит? Тушим, парни, пока не обуглилась! Кастую Produce Water. Какой Феникс?
* Переносного Гатлинга в AD&D не бывает!
* Хрен ли мне твой АКМ, у меня иммунитет к обычному оружию. Как это свинец энчантить научились?
* Пахнет отстоем? Сильно пахнет? Файрболл туда, для озонации.
* У этого друида даже последователей нет. Давайте хлопнем лоха, чтобы не мешался.
* Файрболл не может лежать на земле, это иллюзия!
* Бехолдер? У него ведь абсолютное зрение. Тогда он должен понимать, насколько я крут. Ща мы с ним все обсудим, может, даже шмотьем сторгуемся.
* Все друиды — сопляки. Особенно те, которые прикидываются пнями. Хер О'фант? Какое глупое имя.
* Как это жрица-дроу призывает аватара? Я клерик 18 уровня, а у меня такого заклинания нет!
* Да будь ты хоть трижды рэйнджером, Ксорыч, я тебе говорю: в лесу личей не бывает.
* Летающий череп? Спокойно, парни, это друг. Я в "Плейнскейп: Тормент" играл, знаю.

Or, a variant of one on the list, when a character was playing with a summoning artifact: "I see HOW MANY red dragons??!"  (They ate him)

And the ultimate famous last word:

'''Oops.'''

!!! В две строки

* "A creature with two BABOON heads on a scaly REPTILIAN body?  With TENTACLES for arms?  Hunh.  Must be some stupid wizard's magical construct. Let's kill it."
* "Diamonds ... Gold... Saphires!!! Terry!  Terry, we're rich, we're rich, we're  fabulously wealthy!!!!  Terry...Terry...??"
* "Don't worry!  The chances of me blowing a climb walls roll twice, at my level,  are infinintesimal."
* "Garth, you be the anchor.  I tie the rope around myself, take the slack [700']  and jump in."
* "He CAN'T put a black dragon against a 1st-level party!  It has to be an illusion. I disbelieve!"
* "Hey, it's only a black dragon, a vampire, and a lich.... and we've got a horn of bubbles!"
* "How was I to know that that orc would tell the truth about us not wanting to  come in here!"
* "I drink the bottle marked POISON on the off-chance that it's the extra- healing potion."
* "I'll just fly over the dragon's lair on my pegasus and see if it's still  there"
* "I'll poke it with my sword.." (Pool of Green Slime near cave opening.. it eats through metal very quickly)
* "It's an illusion.  No spell can reshape the side of a mountain like that.  I disbelieve and walk off the 500' cliff."
* "It's just a goblin.." (Or a Doppleganger caught by the PCs trying to steal the goblins' small hord of gold and silver)
* "No, I'm sure there's some stipulation that says a disintegrate spell won't  work if the spellcaster casts it on himself.  Here, I'll prove it."
* "Ok, the dragon's asleep.  You guys wait back here with bows and stuff. Getafix and I will go up in front of it and cast light on it's eyes to  blind him, then we'll blow his brains out with psionics."
* "OK, O Mighty Odin, as long as you're not gonna answer my prayers, I'm gonna  tell ya what I REALLY think of ya!"
* "Oops, I spilled flaming oil on my beard.  I'd better wash it off after we  kill this fire lizard."
* "So I'm safely across the pit?  Whew!  For a minute there I was worried that  you might remember my encumbrance penalties."
* "So what if he calls the guard?  A backwater town like this can't have a very  big militia."
* "Thank God!!  A hobgoblin camp up ahead!  Maybe they can help heal our  wounded!"
* "That's right, I'm going to polymorph into a pergrine falcon and attempt to  land on the back of one of the 12 griffons flying above us."
* "The huge red dragon is flying toward me with his mouth open?  Ok, I roll for  initiative with my bastard sword.
*
"The thief is dead, and we got one coffin left to open!"
"I crack it open with my +1 two-handsword"
- Guess who's in many pieces now!
*
"There's a company of 100 barbarians guarding the pass"
"I don't think they want us to cross these mountains."
"So what?"
* "Well, *I* trust our party thief, and if he says this door isn't trapped,  that's good enough for me."
* "Well, we know he's LAWFUL evil, so he should keep his word when he promised  not to betray us."
* "What a useless scroll. It just says, HASTUR HASTUR HASTUR over and  over again..."
* "What if we drained this fountain that acts as a portal to the elemental plane  of water with my bag of holding?"
* "Ya know, since our druid's been so obnoxious, it would probably serve him  right if we set his precious forest on fire."
* "You mean this is only an 'invoke elemental' ring ? I can't control the  elemental with it."
* "You watch the door, I'll take out the Gas Spore (Beholder) that's guarding  the treasure."
* 5 Fire demons rise from the pit 50 ft in front of the group and the Mage says "No problem I have a Staff of Fire"
* Beeing driven under water by crocodiles: "No problems, I can hold my breath  16 minutes."
*
CLICK!
"What do you mean, 'The trap WASN'T armed.'?  What was that Remove Traps  roll for anyway!?"
* Kender to Bard "Blipdo who?" in reference to Kou-Touan goddess materializing in the same room.

Paladin charging Dragon: "For Honor, for King, for God."

  DM:     You are standing before the gates of the temple. The temple is old and decaying.
  Player: What do the gates look like?
  DM:     They are made of finely polished copper, bright and shiny. There are a lot of animal skeletons scattered on the ground near the gates.
  Player: Must be magical.  I'll pull out my sword, and push the gates open with the tip.
  Gates:  BBBZZZZZZZZZZAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!
  Player: What was that???
  DM:     The million volts of electricity in the gates.
  (The DM like to make electrified traps in dungeons, but he always give clues.  This player didn't pay attention to the clues of polished copper gates, dead animals, and the rest of the temple was falling apart.  Well, at least he was right about them being magical.  Don't worry, the other PCs chipped in to get him raised).

    Astone gloem? i draw my sword and hit it.
    One very good way to lose a sword prob the best i have seen.
    He got out by the way . & I kept telling him he had tickled the golem.

One last thing in one of the groups that i played with last year a char had to seducea femail in order to get a item HE DID and very well to. But he seemed to have forgotten that this was a ADVANCED TECH GAME.
quote       "BUG WHAT BUG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
The poor guy had to give us a blow by blow detailed account of what he had done, it was his face that was the funny thing.

 *****  Borik's Rules To Live By (Or Else Die By)  *****
6. Ogre Mages need to lighten up on the Cones of Cold.
7. Mages should never be allowed to cast Fireball.
8. Don't fire a lightning bolt in a 10x10x10 room
   unless you have a Cube of Force.
9. You CAN make an eyeball pop in two rounds.
10. Disintegration works best if you don't roll a 20.

WISH....
  While this may not be earth-shattering, it did mess things up a bit.  A  certain character who loved killing orcs happened upon a wish.  His wish?  "I wish I had more orcs to fight."  The DM immediately took this one and  flew with it.  The player thought the wish was worded quite well (given   20-30 seconds to do so).  However, instead of merely encountering a   larger percentage of orcs, there were suddenly more orcs...

GADGETS
Ahh, yes, gadgets.  I played DC Heroes once, the 1st Ed, I think.  My friend was playing the Batman.  He was plummetting to a grisly death, kicked out of a helicopter 40 stories up.  We explained the Omnigadgets to him.
"You've got type C Omnigadgets in your utility belt!  Pull one out, it can be whatever you want!"
"Anything?"
"Nearly anything.  Quick!  Use an Omnigadget!"
"Okay, I pull out an Omnigadget."
"What do you want it to be?"
"A cup of tea."
"????   Tea?"
"Orange Pekoe Bat-tea."
Well, he was a Bat-splat shortly thereafter.

5th level Paladin, mounted in splint mail, medium lance, facing an advancing column of field plated lanceman;
"Bring it"
one round till death.

 Just last week I had an unfortunate player awaken from unconsciousness (i.e. 0 hp) and proceed to follow some of the other party members who were checking out a disturbance in the surrounding woods...
Shane:  I see goblins?  I climb the nearest tree.
Daniel: Me too.
Me:     Okay, after a short while they notice Elie (Daniel) and begin to congregate about the base of the tree.  One of them kneels down and rammages through his sack. Kaerin (Shane), you see a few short flashes of light around the goblins hunched over form.  It would seem that he has a light torch now.  By the way, how many  of you have seen or read _The Hobbit_?
...Various exclamations of woe...
Daniel: I jump out of the tree onto one of the goblins.
Me:     You jump out of the tree... into the goblins?
Daniel: Yea.
Me:     Okay...
Shane:  Uh, Daniel, how high were you?
Daniel: Oh no!
Elie:   AAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH...........

My players came upon a crypt with a mummified body in it and the thief was telling one of the fighters:
"Poke it!  It's dead, what is it going to do?"
The mummy came to life and almost wiped out the party.
This thief also has a bad habit of failing his find traps role.  He spends a lot of time taking a so-called 'dirt-nap' and monopolizing healing spells from the two priests.

The huge red dragon is flying toward me with his mouth open?  Ok, I roll for initiative with my bastard sword.
What if we drained this fountain that acts as a portal to the elemental plane of water with my bag of holding?.
Well, he's OK, Know Alignment works on anybod...
Oh, shit.

My elven mage, a human ranger, and a human assassin enter a huge chamber filled with piles upon piles of bones and "awaken" three very angry wraiths.  The mage casts "Protection from Evil".
Ranger:  Coward!  There's only THREE of them!
(okay, we didn't die, but the assassin and mage both lost one experience level and the ranger lost 3 levels)

The party's leader entered alone the room where the big bad guy we slayed was. Couple of seconds later, we hear through the door:
"You can come, there's no danger anymore !(BOOM!!)"

 From a female PC (who [a] encouraged a deity of rape/pillaging to possess one of his priests so they could [b] have sex
"Is that the best you can do?"

We came to a hall, about 15 feet high, with thousands of spikes (2 feet long) fixed to the ceiling. Our self-confident priestess entered the hall and walked about 5 feet towards the center and told us:
 "It's perfectly safe. The spikes won't come down."
She continued to walk and entered a few seconds later a zone of Reverse Gravity...

When crossing a swamp, the atmosphere starts to get ugly. Worried by a very black pool, the group tarries and doesn't want to continue. After an unsuccesfull attempt of our thief to reach the pool, I (a mage!) walk towards it (through the mud and quicksand), examine the black water and return, saying
"Relax, nothing was there..... ??? What are you looking at?"
How about a large black dragon?

This is from a dwarven cleric in my long time gaming party.  The assignment was dealing with clearing a graveyeard which had been sprouting all kinds of nasty surprises.  He had gone ahead of the main party to check something out...
 "You see what looks to be a large flaotingp ball, with a a large central eye, and severl stalks with small eyes at the end.  The things gaze is upon you, though it's not moving in your direction"
 "Bah!  It's just a gas spore!"
 Well, atleast the party had some items to remember him by after the distigration hit.

"Splat"
Me, right after a two-headed troll decided that the party mage would be a very good club.

Here's an old one that i actually was able to use the other day
"What do you mean a 'herd of Terrasque' ?"
We did not survive.
BTW, a kender had gotten hold of a gnomish cloning device. That is bad enough without the Tarrasque.

"Drow have no sense of humor." --The Dragonfly, after being slain by the dark Elf Zik for making fun of his name: "I am Zik."
"How Zik are you?"
