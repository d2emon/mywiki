!! Top 20 Reasons to be a Role-Player:

# Where else can an average every-day guy squash hordes of monsters, save the world, become rich and famous,  AND get the most beautiful woman in all creation to fall in love with him???
# Where else could you tell someone you're wearing a Girdle (of Giant Strength) and not get laughed at!
# Mountain Dew and Doritos. Breakfast of Champions!
# Who else can almost destroy the world, save it, and still have time to finish their pizza before it gets cold?
# You be anything you want without taking on a $50,000 student loan.
# ... if a friend ticks you off, don't get mad, backstab!!!!
# The best reason to role play is to do all of those things safely in a game world that would more than likely get someone thrown in jail (or worse) in the real world. Where else except in a game world of role playing can you over throw a tyrannical government, do in an evil corporation or perhaps get rid of a crime lord without risking life and limb? Role playing is not only a good way to vent, it also a good way to put artistic merit to that venting.
# I fancy myself as an actor and a comedian. Role-playing let's me do both. Case in point my T'Skrang Swordmaster is a mix of Centauri intrigue and Ferengi commerce. Which makes a great character to have fun with.
# Because there is virtually no drawback to role-playing--especially table-top RPGing.
## It's safe; you are generally in a home or a convention... maybe a restaraunt.
## It's literary; you HAVE to be able to read to keep up.
## It's social; try running a game by yourself!
## It spurs the imagination!
## It's cheap! One person buys a module and a whole group of people can enjoy the interactive storytelling.
## It grows along with the players. The more everyone puts in the more everyone gets out--name another game that does that.
## It's fun.
# It's a lot cheaper and creative than hangin' in the bar with the pals. Many bar visitors leave the place with no money and no memories - role-players leave the gaming session with their money and a lot of fun memories.
# Because real life doesn't have saving throws.
# It makes learning about military ordnance fun!
# Why be a role-player? To let one's alter ego out to play once in a while... Ok, more then once in a while.
# It affords us the opportunity to face the unknown, challenge the forces and nature and push our morals to the breaking point all from the comfortale safety of our barco-lounger.
