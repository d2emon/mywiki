Into the strange, psychedelic world of the mainframe and you should run and
jump quickly down the left hand side to escape the collapsing bridge then
make a dive into the heart of the CPU. Increased agility will help you defeat the
cybernetic bear, but pick up the stars to defeat the flying beast and you'll
obtain bonus stars and an extra battery. Defeat the cybernetic alien to rescue your
gal, then take a dip in the shark pool and collect energy stars to destroy the
virus once and for all and finally restore the balance of time. Phew.
