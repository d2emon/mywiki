Race along the trench and dive into the next dug-out to find the first MUT
of the level. Sprint forward and evade the Red Baron, then, once you reach the
barbed wire, search to the very far left to find the box of grenades with which to
wreck the machine gun nest. Go through the wire and once you've gunned down the
platoon, duck into the back of the machine gun post to perform the next
memory upload.
Storm the barn and bayonet the grenadier upstairs to find an extra life
battery and a box of grenades, then once you've moved into the ruined village, 
search to find an extra life, some bonus chips and health cubes. Batter your way 
into the bar and search for extra chips behind the counter, then head for the cellar, 
where a well deserved glass of vino, signals the end of this world war's endeavours.
In the urban section, make sure you take out the VC woman first and pick up
the splendid AK47 assault rifle. The pooch will act as your guide, and take you
into the gatepost where you should hit the red button to open the barrier. Sprint
across the bridge taking out the bazooka men, then scarper down into the subway and
find the MUT located to the right of the stairs, turning quickly to spray
the approaching grenadiers. Back on the streets, you should resort to sustained
bazooka fire to take out any troublesome snipers, then dart into the
derelict building to pick up some bonus chips. When you hit the main square, deal
with the posse of men and dogs with extreme prejudice and shoulder your bazooka
to take on the tank. Finally, simply answer the phone to escape from this era.
