!! Войны будущего

There's a veritable saucerful of secrets in the first room, with two ray
guns and extra life on offer, but then you should lay down suppressing fire in the
corridor and sneak around the far end to get a bonus life battery and chips. Ice the
two robots in the next room and upload at the MUT, then use the captured
multi-laser to deal with the aerial threat.
An extra multi-laser can be found to the right of the elevator and as you
descend, blow away the acrobat to gain a combat yo-yo,  which is a much more useful
weapon than it sounds. When you reach rock bottom, deploy the multi-laser to
punch your way through the first robots and mines, then launch a close
assault on the scorpion and dog droids with the yo-yo, for maximum carnage. Terminate
the robots guar ding the shuttle, then climb aboard for the long ride down.
Bug hunt the first aliens, then hit the control room in the landing bay and
search for extra chips, life and a handy box of grenades. More aliens and a
Scorpion droid await in the next airlock, and, once you've fought your way through,
open the blast doors to find both an MUT and a space suit. Beware of the zombies
playing dead in the next corridor and search the barrels to find more
grenades which you should employ on the next blast door. Seek out the hidden control
room for an extra life, then sprint up the corridor to your next MUT. Once
you've made it to the walkway, step into the elevator for a hidden extra life
battery then hit the button to bring up the platform. Pepper the ultra alien with
grenades and sweep up the remaining bonuses but be sure to don your space suit before
hitting the final button.
