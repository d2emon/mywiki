!! Eternal Companion

The Eternal Companion, also known as the Companion to Champions, is a cosmic archetype, and manifests as the various "sidekicks" of the Eternal Champion. The Companion, generally speaking, is more easy going and lighthearted than the typically brooding Champion, and often, but not always, serves as a source of comic relief.

Companions seem to rarely if ever question the wisdom of being allied to the Champions; it is conceivable that somehow they have no choice on the matter. When asked by Elric, Moonglum changes the subject.

The Companion sometimes seems to have a full awareness of his/her true nature and also the natures of the Eternal Champion and the Multiverse itself.

Aspects of the Eternal Companion include:

* Jaspar Colinadous (with Elric in the Dream Realms)
* Jermays the Crooked (brief ally to Urlik Skarsol, Prince Flamadin, and Elric)
* Jhary-a-Conel (mostly Corum, sometimes Hawkmoon)
* Alnac Kreb (Elric's companion in The Fortress of the Pearl)
* Moonglum (Elric's companion for most of his journeys)
* Oladahn (Hawkmoon)
* Gurni Gurnisson (Ulrich's companion)
