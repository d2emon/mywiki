!! Кен Сьерра

!!! История

!!!! Основание

В 1979 году программист IBM Кен Уильямс и его супруга Роберта Уильямс основали компанию On-Line Systems с целью разработки графических игр для компьютера Apple II. Игры оказались востребованными и принесли быстрый успех. В 1982 году компания переместилась в Оукхёрст (Калифорния) (англ.)русск. у подножья горного хребта Сьерра-Невада и была переименована в Sierra On-Line[1].

!!!! Годы расцвета

С середины 1980-х до середины 1990-х компания упрочила свой авторитет на рынке компьютерных игр, выпустив множество передовых приключенческих игр собственной разработки, завоевавших широкую популярность.

!!!! Продажа и уход из разработки

В июле 1996 года Sierra On-Line была продана компании CUC International (англ.)русск.. Сразу после продажи Кен Уильямс оставил пост главного исполнительного директора (англ. CEO). Тем не менее он продолжал взаимодействовать с подразделением программного обеспечения в качестве вице-президента CUC, стараясь определять стратегическую линию Sierra. Однако спустя год Кен и Роберта Уильямс покинули компанию.

В декабре 1997 года произошло слияние CUC International и HFC Incorporated, результатом чего стало появление Cendant Corporation (англ.)русск.. Разразившийся в 1998 году скандал, связанный с финансовыми нарушениями, осуществлявшимися в течение нескольких лет управленческим персоналом CUC, вызвал длительные судебные разбирательства, и стоимость акций компании упала с 39 долларов за штуку до 20, что повлекло за собой невосполнимые финансовые потери. 22 февраля 1999 года были закрыты многие производственные студии Sierra, около 135 человек потеряли работу.

Несмотря на роспуск большего количества разработчиков, компания продолжала выступать в роли издателя независимых игр, среди которых были такие известные, как Half-Life, World in Conflict, Homeworld 2, TimeShift, SWAT 4.

В 2003 году Sierra Entertainment выпустила вторую адаптацию видеоигр про Хоббита.

По указанию материнской компании Vivendi Universal Games для устранения финансовых проблем и по причине отсутствия доходности в качестве разработчика были предприняты очередные меры по сокращению штата. Impressions Games и Papyrus Design Group были закрыты весной 2004 года, и около 50 человек потеряли свои рабочие места; 180 человек были уволены в офисах Vivendi в Лос-Анджелесе, а в июне 2004 года, VU Games закрыли Bellevue Sierra, что оставило более 100 человек без работы, которые однако были распределены на работу по другим подразделениям компании и переехали в штаб-квартиру Vivendi Universal Games во Фресно (Калифорния). Другие студии, такие как Print Artist, были окончательно закрыты. Франшиза Hoyle была продана независимому разработчику. В общей сложности 350 человек потеряли свои рабочие места.

В конце 2005 года бренд «Sierra» был вновь запущен в Лос-Анджелесе, в том числе марка «Sierra Online», которая должна была сосредоточиться на онлайне.

В 2005—2006 годах были куплены либо переданы от материнской компании Vivendi студии Massive Entertainment, High Moon Studios, Radical Entertainment, Secret Lair Studios / Studio Ch’in (базируется в Сиэтле и Шанхае) и Swordfish Studios. В результате этих ротаций Sierra получила бренды «Crash Bandicoot», «Spyro the Dragon», «50 Cent: Bulletproof and Scarface». Однако после 2008 года компания пропала и с издательских горизонтов.

!!!! Возвращение

В результате множества последующих внутренних перепродаж между владельцами бренда, Sierra попала под крыло Activision[2] и 8 августа 2014 года на YouTube появился ролик, свидетельствующий о возрождении бренда, с призывом ожидать подробностей после Gamescom.

* King's Quest IV — цикл дня/ночи; первая игра, которая поддерживает стерео (звуковая плата).
* King's Quest V — первая игра, выпущенная на компакт-дисках. Первый проект Sierra’s VGA, хотя несколько других студий издали игры VGA (даже игры-приключения VGA) раньше.
* King’s Quest VII: The Princeless Bride — первая и последняя игра серии, вышедшая в мультяшном стиле FMV.
* The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery — в отличие от первой части Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, вышла в FMV. Оказалась самой проработанной частью серии. Номинировалась на лучшую игру жанра интерактивное кино.
* Phantasmagoria — первый интерактивный хоррор-квест.
* Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail! — последняя часть классической квестовой серии Leisure Suit Larry, вышедшая в FMV в стиле King’s Quest VII: The Princeless Bride, то есть, в мультяшном стиле. Аналогично предыдущей части, все персонажи были озвучены.
* Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh — стала первой игрой в мире с максимально реалистичной графикой за счёт использования FMV не только с актёрами, но и с окружением (на момент ноября-декабря 1996 года Windows-версия имела лучшую игровую графику во всём мире). В отличие от первой Phantasmagoria, игровой процесс увеличился с 1.5 до 4 с лишним часов. Однако, обильное использование возрастных элементов, таких как кровь, жестокость, насилие, эротический контент и присутствие темы гомосексуализма и бисексуализма серьёзно занизило ей рейтинг среди игровых издательств западных стран.

----

Sierra Entertainment, Inc. (formerly On-Line Systems and Sierra On-Line, Inc.) was an American video game developer and publisher based in Bellevue, Washington.

Founded in 1979 as On-Line Systems, by Ken and Roberta Williams,[2] Sierra was known primarily for their graphic adventure game series such as King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Gabriel Knight, and Quest for Glory. They were also known for their PC racing games based on the NASCAR license, their Caesar simulation series, and their Hoyle line of licensed card game software.

Sierra On-Line was acquired by CUC International in February 1996 and became part of CUC International's newly established CUC Software (sold and renamed multiple times until becoming Vivendi Universal Games in 2001).

In June 2004, after months of significant downsizing and restructuring at the company, Sierra Entertainment as a company was downsized and eventually shut down, and were fully disestablished as a company on August 27, 2004.[1] The Sierra brand name was retained by Vivendi Universal Games (later Vivendi Games) as a publishing label until 2008, and was revived by Activision in 2014 for mainly re-releasing older titles.

!!! History

!!!! Founding

Sierra Entertainment was founded in 1979[2] as On-Line Systems in Simi Valley, California, by Ken and Roberta Williams. Ken, a programmer for IBM, bought an Apple II microcomputer which he planned to use to develop a Fortran compiler for the Apple II. At the time, his wife Roberta was playing text adventure games on the Apple II. Dissatisfied with the text-only format, she realized that the graphics display capability of the Apple II could enhance the adventure gaming experience. After initial success, On-Line Systems was renamed Sierra On-Line in 1982, and the company moved to Oakhurst, California.[3] By early 1984 InfoWorld estimated that Sierra was the world's 12th-largest microcomputer-software company, with $12.5 million in 1983 sales.[4]

!!!! 1980s
In 1980, On-Line Systems released their first game in the Hi-Res Adventure series, Mystery House. Roberta wrote the script for the adventure game in three weeks, then presented it to Ken. At this point, Roberta convinced Ken to help her develop the game in the evenings after work. She worked on the text and the graphics, and told Ken how to put it all together to make it the game she wanted. They worked on it for about three months and, on May 5, 1980, Mystery House was ready for shipment. Mystery House was an instant hit. It was the first computer adventure game to have graphics, although they were crude, monochrome, static line drawings. It sold about 15,000 copies and earned $167,000.

The Hi-Res Adventure series continued with Mission Asteroid, which was released as Hi-Res Adventure #0, despite being the second release. The next release, Wizard and the Princess, also known as Adventure in Serenia, is considered a prelude to the later King's Quest series in both story and concept.[5] Through 1981 and 1982, more games were released in the series including Cranston Manor, Ulysses and the Golden Fleece, Time Zone, and The Dark Crystal. A simplified version of The Dark Crystal, intended for a younger audience, was written by Al Lowe and released as Gelfling Adventure.

Many of Sierra's most well known series began in the 1980s. In 1983, Sierra On-Line was contacted by IBM to create a game for its new PCjr. IBM would fund the entire development of the game, pay royalties for it, and advertise for the game. Ken and Roberta accepted and started on the project. Roberta created a story featuring classic fairy-tale elements. Her game concept included animated color graphics, a pseudo 3D-perspective where the main character was visible on the screen, a more competent text parser that would understand advanced commands from the player, and music playing in the background through the PCjr sound hardware. For the game, a complete development system called Adventure Game Interpreter was developed. In the summer of 1984, King's Quest was released to much acclaim, beginning the King's Quest series.

While working to finish The Black Cauldron, programmers Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy began to plan for an adventure game of their own. After a simple demonstration to Ken, he allowed them to start working on the full game, which was named Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter. The game, released in October 1986, was an instant success and would spawn many sequels in the following years as part of the Space Quest series.

Al Lowe, who had been working at Sierra On-Line for many years, was asked by Ken to write a modern version of Chuck Benton's Softporn Adventure from 1981, the only pure text adventure that the company had ever released. Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards was a great hit (although it first became famous as an early example of software piracy, as Sierra sold many more hintbooks than actual copies of the game) and won the Software Publishers Association's Best Adventure Game award of 1987. A long series of Leisure Suit Larry games would follow in the coming years.

Ken befriended a retired highway patrol officer named Jim Walls, and asked him to produce an adventure series based on a police theme. Walls proceeded to create Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel, which was released in 1987. Several sequels followed, and series was touted for its adherence to police protocol (relevant parts of which were explained in the games' manuals), and presenting some real-life situations encountered by Walls during his career as an officer.

Quest for Glory is a series of hybrid adventure/role-playing video games designed by Corey and Lori Ann Cole. The first game in the series, Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero, was released in 1989. The series combined humor, puzzle elements, themes and characters borrowed from various legends, puns, and memorable characters, creating a 5-part series of the Sierra stable. Although the series was originally titled Hero's Quest, Sierra failed to trademark the name. Milton Bradley successfully trademarked an electronic version of their unrelated joint Games Workshop board game, HeroQuest, which forced Sierra to change the series' title to Quest for Glory. This decision caused all future games in the series (as well as newer releases of Hero's Quest I) to switch over to the new name.

In 1987, Sierra On-Line started to publish their own gaming magazine, where one could read about their upcoming games and interviews with the developers. The magazine was initially named The Sierra Newsletter, The Sierra News Magazine and The Sierra/Dynamix Newsmagazine. However, since Sierra Club already published a magazine called Sierra Magazine, the name of the magazine published by Sierra On-Line was changed to InterAction in 1991. The magazine InterAction was discontinued in 1999.

Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter engine, introduced with King's Quest, was replaced in 1988[6] with Sierra's Creative Interpreter in King's Quest IV. The game was released under both engines, so those who had newer computers could use the new engine and its better rendering technology.[7]

!!!! 1990s
In 1990, Sierra released King's Quest V. It was the first Sierra On-Line game ever to sell more than 500,000 copies and was the highest selling game for the next five years. It won several awards as well, such as the Best Adventure Game of the Year from both the Software Publishers Association and Computer Gaming World magazine.

The ImagiNation Network, the first game-only online environment,[8] began development in 1989.[citation needed] It was launched on May 6, 1991, as the Sierra Network.[8] Providing a "land-based" precursor to MMORPGs and internet chat rooms, each land theme for the type of content provided multi-player gaming and category based bulletin boards and chat rooms throughout the continental United States. AT&T took sole possession of the network on November 15, 1994, and as a result the name was changed to the ImagiNation Network.[8] The network failed to find a mass audience.[9]

In 1991, Sierra released the first title in the Dr. Brain series, Castle of Dr. Brain, a hybrid puzzle adventure education game, which had several sequels. In 1993, Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers was released, beginning the Gabriel Knight series. Generally considered to be a staple of the point-and-click adventure genre,[citation needed] the game and its sequels were critically acclaimed in the mainstream press at the time.

Sierra and Broderbund ended merger discussions in March 1991.[10]

Sierra had grown enormously since its first years, and a new building would be needed to expand its operations to continue making games. A decision was made to move the headquarters north to Bellevue, Washington. Sierra's original location in Oakhurst continued as an internal development studio for the company, and was later renamed Yosemite Entertainment.

The company was now made up of five separate and largely autonomous development divisions: Sierra Publishing, Sierra Northwest, Dynamix, Bright Star Technology, and Coktel Vision, with each group working separately on product development but sharing manufacturing, distribution, and sales resources.

The year 1995 would prove to be an extremely successful year for the company. Sierra was the market-share leader in PC games for the year.[11] With $83.4 million in sales from its software-publishing business, earnings improved by 19 percent, bringing a net income of $11.9 million to the company. In June 1995, Sierra and Pioneer Electric Corp. signed an agreement to create a joint venture that would develop, publish, manufacture, and market entertainment software for the Japanese software market. This joint venture created a new company called Sierra Venture. With Sierra and Pioneer investing over $12 million, the new company immediately manufactured and shipped over twenty of Sierra's most popular products to Japan and created new titles for the Japanese market.[citation needed] 1995 also saw Sierra acquiring a number of development companies, both small home developers and larger companies.[12]

Phantasmagoria was by far the largest project ever undertaken by Sierra. At the time of its release in late 1995, the anticipation for the game was high. Although nearly one million copies were sold when the game was first released in August 1995, making it the bestselling Sierra adventure game created, the game received mixed reviews from industry critics.[13]

!!!!! Sold to CUC
In February 1996, early e-commerce pioneer CUC International, seeking to expand into interactive entertainment, offered to buy Sierra at a price of about $1.5 billion.[citation needed]. Walter Forbes, the CEO of CUC International, and a member of Sierra's own Board of Directors since 1991, surprised Ken with the deal after a board meeting. After negotiating terms which Ken felt would be in best interest for Sierra's future, the deal with CUC closed on July 24, 1996. Among the terms included that Ken would be named a Vice-Chairman of CUC International, a Member of the Office of the President of CUC, and would remain responsible for Sierra's R&D as well as remaining Sierra's CEO.[14] He also requested that a "software board" be created. The board would be comprised of himself, Michael Brochu (Sierra's President and COO), Bob Davidson (founder and CEO of Davidson & Associates and Forbes; the function of this board would be to act as a governing body of what would become CUC Software, regulating major decisions and product lines.

In September 1996, CUC announced plans to consolidate some of the functions of its game companies into a single company called CUC Software Inc., headquartered in Torrance, California. Bob Davidson, founder and CEO of Davidson & Associates became the CEO for the publishing body. CUC Software would consolidate the manufacturing, distribution, and sales resources of all of its divisions that would come to include Sierra, Davidson, Blizzard, Knowledge Adventure, and Gryphon Software.

CUC Software would utilize its various labels' market specialties; for example, in October 1996, Sierra published Stay Tooned!, an adventure game developed by Funnybone Interactive, a subsidiary of Davidson & Associates, as Sierra was more known as an adventure game publisher than Davidson.

In November 1996, Ken met with the founders of Valve and negotiated Sierra's exclusive rights to publish Half-Life,[15] which Ken debuted at E3 in May 1997. In December 1996, Sierra released The Realm Online, an online fantasy roleplaying game.

After the sale, Ken remained within the software division so that he could provide strategic guidance to Sierra, although he began to grow disillusioned as he soon found that his new titles at CUC meant very little and the software board met only once. He also began to have disputes with Davidson over Davidson's conservative management style and his disdain for Sierra's more risque product lines such as Phantasmagoria and Leisure Suit Larry.[16]

In January 1997, Davidson stepped down as CEO of CUC Software, and CUC Executive Chris MacLeod was named as his replacement.[17] After this, Ken shifted his focus work on CUC's online product distributor, NetMarket while remaining as CEO of Sierra in name only. In November, Ken departed from CUC International, while Roberta remained with Sierra until the release of King's Quest: Mask of Eternity in December 1998. Brochu, who had been hired in 1995 by Ken, to handle the day to day business affairs of Sierra, replaced Ken and remained as President of Sierra until October 1997, when he too would depart the company.

In April 1997, to further expand upon their role in the edutainment business, Sierra. purchased Books That Work and CUC International purchased Berkeley Systems and transferred management of the studio to Sierra as an internal developer.[18] In December 1997, in order to secure the rights to Return to Krondor, Sierra purchased PyroTechnix, who were developing the game.

On November 5, 1997, after the departure of Brochu in October, Sierra was split into three business units, all of which would report directly to MacLeod.[19]

!!!!! Cendant Corporation
In December 1997, CUC merged with HFS Incorporated. The two companies jointly formed the Cendant Corporation with more than 40,000 employees and operations in over 100 countries.

In 1998, Sierra split up its organization into 4 sub-brands and corporate divisions:[20]

Sierra Attractions (For casual games such as poker) - composed of Berkeley Systems
Sierra Home (For home/lifestyle software) - composed of Sierra's gardening, home design, and cooking software divisions
Sierra Sports (For sports games) - composed of Dynamix, Synergistic Software, and Papyrus
Sierra Studios (General publishing division) - Composed of Sierra Northwest/Bellevue, Pyrotechnix, and Impressions Software[21]
Sierra FX (Adventure Games and Online Multiplayer Games) - Based at Sierra's old headquarters in Oakhurst, which was publicly referred to as Yosemite Entertainment.
On November 24, 1997, Sierra published Diablo: Hellfire, the official expansion pack for the widely popular game Diablo. It was developed by Synergistic Software, a division of Sierra.

On November 19, 1998, Sierra published Half-Life for the PC, developed by Valve Corporation, widely considered to be one of the greatest games of all time.

In March 1998, massive accounting fraud at CUC was exposed. With the news, Cendant announced its intention to sell off its computer entertainment division, and on November 20, 1998, announced the sale of its entire consumer software division to Paris-based Havas S.A. Sierra became a part of Havas Interactive, the interactive entertainment division of the company.

!!!!! Major layoffs
On February 22, 1999, Sierra announced a major reorganization of the company, resulting in the shutdown of several of their development studios, cutbacks on others and the relocation of key projects, and employees from those studios, to Bellevue. About 250 people in total lost their jobs. Development groups within Sierra such as PyroTechnix were shut down. Others such as Books That Work were relocated to Bellevue. Also shut down was Yosemite Entertainment, the division occupying the original headquarters of Sierra On-Line. The company sold the rights of Headgate Studios back to the original owner.[22] With the exception of the warehouse and distribution department, the entire studio was shut down. Game designers Al Lowe and Scott Murphy were laid off. Lowe had just started work on Leisure Suit Larry 8. Murphy was involved in a Space Quest 7 project at the time. Layoffs continued on March 1, when Sierra terminated 30 employees at the previously unaffected Dynamix, 15 percent of its workforce.

Despite the layoffs, Sierra continued to publish games for smaller development houses. In September 1999, they released Homeworld, a real-time space-combat strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment. The game design was revolutionary for the genre, and the game received great critical acclaim and many awards.

!!!!! Yosemite Entertainment legacy
UK-based game developer and publisher Codemasters, in an effort to establish themselves in the United States, announced that it would launch a new development studio in Oakhurst, using the abandoned Sierra facilities and hiring much of the Yosemite Entertainment's laid-off staff in mid-September 1999. In early October, the company announced that it would take over management and maintenance of the online RPG The Realm and that it would pick up and complete the previously canceled Navy SEALs. The company also reported that it had obtained the rights to continue using the name Yosemite Entertainment for the development house.

!!!!! Reorganization
Meanwhile, Sierra announced another reorganization, this time into three business units: Core Games, Casual Entertainment, and Home Productivity. This reorganization resulted in even more layoffs, eliminating 105 additional jobs and a number of games in production. After 1999, Sierra almost entirely ceased to be a developer of games and, as time went on, instead became a publisher of games by independent developers.

!!!! 2000s
At the end of June 2000, a strategic business alliance between Vivendi, Seagram, and Canal+ was announced, and Vivendi Universal, a leading global media and communications company, was formed after the merger with Seagram (the parent company of Universal Studios). Havas S.A. was renamed Vivendi Universal Publishing and became the publishing division of the new group, divided into five groups: games, education, literature, health, and information. The merger was followed by many more layoffs of Sierra employees.

In August 2001, Sierra announced a major reorganization, which included the closure of Dynamix as well as the layoffs of 148 employees located at the company headquarters in Bellevue.[23]

On February 19, 2002, Sierra On-Line officially announced the change of its name to Sierra Entertainment, Inc.

In 2002, Sierra, working with High Voltage Software, announced the development of a new chapter in the Leisure Suit Larry franchise, titled Leisure Suit Larry: Magna Cum Laude. It was released to mostly mixed to negative reviews; Larry's creator, Lowe, was not involved with the project.

The newly renamed Sierra Entertainment continued to develop mostly unsuccessful interactive entertainment products. However, its hit Homeworld 2 once again cemented Sierra's reputation as a respectable publisher.

In 2003, Sierra Entertainment released the second video game adaptation of The Hobbit, as well as NASCAR Racing 2003 Season.

!!!! 2004–2008, Restructuring and usage as a brand name and publishing label
In the spring of 2004, Cost-cutting measures were taken at Sierra's parent company Vivendi Universal Games due to financial troubles and because of Sierra's lack of profitability as a working developer. Sierra's last owned studios Impressions Games and the Papyrus Design Group were both shut down in the spring of 2004, losing 50 jobs in the process; 180 Sierra-related positions were also eliminated at Vivendi's Los Angeles offices; and by June 2004, Vivendi had completely shut down Sierra's Bellevue location, which cost over 100 people their jobs and dispersed Sierra's work to other VU Games divisions, and re-locating the remains of Sierra's assets to Vivendi's corporate headquarters in Fresno, California. In total, 350 people lost their jobs. Various titles that were retired in the process included Print Artist and titles like the Hoyle franchise were sold to other publishers or developers. Sierra by this point was simply a publishing label and brand name for Vivendi titles, being used in tandom with their own name for publishing.

In late 2005, the Sierra brand was re-launched from Los Angeles. A new subsidiary called Sierra Online (no-relation to Sierra's former name Sierra On-Line) was also founded within this time, which would focus on download games and online-only titles.

Throughout 2005 and 2006, Vivendi acquired several game development studios including Massive Entertainment, High Moon Studios, Radical Entertainment, Secret Lair Studios / Studio Ch'in (based in Seattle and Shanghai) and Swordfish Studios and integrated them into Sierra, alongside the creative licenses from other Vivendi divisions and from companies partnered with Vivendi and the copyrights of several notable intellectual properties, such as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, 50 Cent: Bulletproof and Scarface. Vivendi also ceased publishing under their own name by this point after their name change, with all major titles being released under the Sierra brand name.

Caesar IV was published September 26, 2006 in North America, in partnership with Tilted Mill Entertainment.

In the summer of 2007, Sierra Online began launching Xbox Live Arcade titles for the Xbox 360. One of its first releases was the conversion of the successful "German-style" board game Carcassonne, which had been in development at Secret Lair Studios.

In September 2007, Sierra released the real-time tactical video game World in Conflict.

In October 2007, Sierra released TimeShift.

In 2008, Sierra Entertainment's parent company Vivendi merged with video game publisher Activision to form the Activision Blizzard holding company. Vivendi was absorbed into Activision after the merger and the ownership of Sierra and its properties went to Activision. Later that year, Sierra was closed down for possible future sale.

On July 29, 2008, Activision dropped several planned Sierra titles due for release that weren't a strong fit with their long-term strategy.[24] Upcoming titles like Crash: Mind Over Mutant, The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon and Prototype were retained by Activision. Many of the former planned Vivendi/Sierra published titles were sold on to other publishers. Ghostbusters: The Video Game and The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena were sold to Atari, Inc., Brütal Legend was sold to Electronic Arts, WET was sold to Bethesda Softworks, 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand was sold to THQ and World in Conflict: Soviet Assault was sold to Ubisoft, who also acquired Massive Entertainment. Swordfish Studios was sold to Codemasters.

!!!! 2010s – brand name revival

On August 7, 2014, the website for Sierra, which previously redirected to Activision's website, was updated, showcasing a new logo, teasing: "More to be revealed at Gamescom 2014." The revived Sierra Entertainment will re-release some of their older games,[25] re-imagining their older franchises, as well as collaborate with indie studios to create new "innovative, edgy and graphically unique" projects.[26] Sierra will focus on publishing downloadable games through PlayStation Network, Steam for PC and Xbox Live.[27] "We're very proud of what we created all those years ago with Sierra On-Line, and today's news about carrying Sierra forward as an indie-specific brand is very encouraging," said founder Ken in an official statement. "We look forward to seeing Sierra's independent spirit live on."[28] On the same day, King's Quest and Geometry Wars 3: Dimensions were announced; they were the first two games published under the revived Sierra brand.[29]

On December 5, 2014, they were awarded with the "Industry Icon" award during the 2014 The Game Awards, and they also introduced the first footage from the reboot of King's Quest.[30]

!!! Early Days

Founded in 1980 as On-Line Systems, the company began when Ken Williams took on the daunting task of programming his wife Roberta's hand-written game concept into the first graphic/text adventure game ever created. Dubbed Hi-Res Adventure #1: Mystery House, the game's marriage of text and graphics became the product upon which all other graphics adventures were measured.

The success of the game allowed Ken and Roberta to move out of Los Angeles, first to Coarsegold, later to Oakhurst, California. Relating to their new location at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the company changed its name to Sierra On-Line in 1982.

Soon after the success of Mystery House, Roberta Williams created her second adventure game, the Wizard and the Princess, which sold more than sixty thousand copies; a substantial sell through for the early 1980s. Like her previous game, it set the industry standard for home computer entertainment.

The following years brought many similar successes. Sierra's most popular series, King's Quest, earned international recognition and numerous industry awards. To date the series has sold more than 3 million copies, making Roberta Williams one of the best-selling computer game designers in the industry.

Over the years Sierra On-Line, Inc. has had some of the best-selling game series that can be directly attributed to some of the best-known names in computer game development. Including renowned designers Roberta Williams (King's Quest), David Lester (Lords of the Realm, Caesar), Jane Jensen (Gabriel Knight), David Kaemmer (Indy Car, NASCAR Racing), Jeff Tunnell (Starsiege) and Al Lowe (Leisure Suit Larry).

!!! Acquisitions

A series of acquisitions has helped Sierra expand its development expertise into additional categories including sports, simulations, strategy, home productivity, and casual entertainment. 

Founded in 1984 by Jeff Tunnell and Damon Slye, Dynamix became a member of the Sierra family in 1990. Dynamix then expanded its product line to include the multi-award winning Red Baron, Aces of the Pacific and Aces over Europe. In addition to the flight sim titles of those earlier years, Dynamix published family titles (Incredible Machine and 3-D Ultra Pinball). Dynamix has developed products for three of Sierra's family of brands: Sierra Attractions (3-D Ultra’ line), Sierra Sports (Trophy Bass), and Dynamix, a Sierra Company (flight simulations and action games).

Bright Star Technologies entered the Sierra family in 1992. Founded by Elon Gasper, inventor of HyperAnimation and the principal author of Alphabet Blocks, Bright Star is a key player in multimedia technology. In addition to the well-known Talking Tutors series, Bright Star has developed multimedia language programs such as Berlitz Live! Spanish and Berlitz Live! Japanese.

Sierra's 1993 acquisition of Coktel Vision, a Paris-based developer and publisher of education and entertainment software, added titles such as Goblins and the Inca series to the Sierra family of products.

1995 saw a number of acquisitions, primarily in the home productivity genre. In May, Sierra purchased the rights to Print Artist, a program that enables users to quickly and easily create and print their own professional-quality documents. The acquisition of Green Thumb Software contributed home gardening and landscape products to the company's growing home productivity line. Arion software, publisher of the acclaimed MasterCook culinary series, was folded into the Sierra family in September.

During 1995, Sierra purchased Impressions Games, a leading publisher of strategy games. Known for such products as Caesar II, Caesar III, Lords of the Realm, High Seas Trader and The Blue and The Gray, Impressions improved Sierra's strategy game offerings.

Sierra also purchased Papyrus Design Group and SubLogic in 1995. Papyrus, was primarily known for its racing simulations was the developer of NASCAR Racing. SubLogic developed flight simulation software within Dynamix. 

Sierra completed two acquisitions in April of 1997. The first was Berkeley Systems, publishers of the You Don't Know Jack series and the commercially successful After Dark screensaver series and the popular bezerk network. Books That Work also joined the Sierra family. Books That Work develops software that guides users through the design, visualization and building processes of home-related projects, such as landscapes, gardens, decks, kitchens, and entire houses. Its best-known titles include 3D Deck, 3D Kitchen, 3D Landscape, and Visual Home.

!!! Sierra sold to CUC International

In 1996, Sierra was sold for $1.06 billion in stock to CUC International. The acquisition, announced on February 20, 1996, was completed on July 24, 1996. By then CUC (Comp-U-Card) International was a Stamford, Connecticut based, technology-driven retail and membership services company that provided access to travel, shopping, auto, dining, home improvement, financial, and other services to nearly 40 million consumers worldwide. Chairman of CUC was Walter Forbes, one of the members of the board of Sierra.

!!! Cendant Merger

A year later Sierra became part of Cendant Software, at that time one of the largest PC consumer software groups in the world. On December 18, 1997, CUC merged with HFS Incorporated and became Cendant Corporation. Cendant Software consolidated the sales, manufacturing, finance, accounting and management of Cendant Corporation's software divisions, including Sierra, Knowledge Adventure, Davidson & Associates, Inc. and Blizzard Entertainment.

!!! Havas Interactive Acquisition and Afterwards

In January of 1999, Sierra and its affiliates were acquired by Havas, S.A. Through the acquisition, Cendant Software became Havas Interactive. Its holdings were, Blizzard, Coktel, Knowledge Adventure, Sierra, and WON.net. Havas Interactive had operations in the US and in Europe and is a subsidiary of the French publishing house Havas, part of Vivendi Communications. In June 2000, Havas Interactive was reformed as Vivendi Universal and on October 2001, Sierra's logo was reverted to the famous Half-Dome logo. Afterwards, on February 19, 2002, Sierra On-Line was renamed to Sierra Entertainment.

The year 2004, however, was a bad year for Sierra. Sierra's parent company, Vivendi Universal Games, decided to take cost-cutting measures and the former subsidiaries of Sierra, all renowned companies such as Impressions and Papyrus were shut down in spring of 2004, while Sierra's HQ in Bellevue was shut down in June of the same year for good. From then on, Sierra became a label of Vivendi Universal Games.

However, in late 2005, Sierra was relaunched, this time from Los Angeles, with a new brand, Sierra Online, for indie publishing purposes. Also, new companies that acquired by Vivendi Games were joined to the Sierra family, including High Moon, Radical, Swordfish, Massive and Secret Lair, with the latter renamed to Sierra Online Seattle and Sierra Online Shanghai(Chinese division of Secret Lair), respectively. Also, some Vivendi Games properties, most notably the Crash Bandicoot, were transferred to Sierra.

In July 2008, however, Vivendi Games was merged with Activision that resulted to a new holding company, Activision Blizzard, making Sierra redundant. On October 2008, Sierra was disbanded, with majority of it's subsidiaries, with the exception of High Moon and Radical, are either closed or sold, with all of their titles that listed as TBA at the time were either cancelled or published under the Activision brand.

!!! Revival of the Sierra Brand

In August 2014, the website of Sierra was updated, with a new logo and a text, saying that they would be on GamesCom 2014. Afterwards, Sierra, this time a continuation of the former Sierra Online division rather than Sierra itself, has unveiled two games - Geometry Wars 3 and King's Quest, slated to be released in November 25, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
