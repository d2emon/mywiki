Other geographic features

||
||Amir Jehun Pass				||Takes its name from a combination of the Amu Darya river and the Gihon river (Jayhoun in Arabic), which has been identified by some with the Amu Darya. Perhaps corresponds to the Broghol Pass, which is near the headwaters of the Amu Darya in Wakhan.	||
||The Himelian Mountains	||Take their name from the Himalayas but correspond more closely to the Hindu Kush or Karakoram ranges.									||
||The Karpash Mountains	||The Carpathian Mountains.																																									||
||The Poitanian Mountains	||The Pyrenees, which are just south of the Aquitaine region of France.																								||
||The River Styx					||The River Styx runs northward through Stygia, following the course of the historical Nile river. Then it turns and runs westward through Shem, following the historical Mediterranean Sea, finally emptying into the western ocean. Styx, in classical mythology, is the River of the Dead and this symbolism is used in The Hour of the Dragon.												||
||The River Alimane			||Alamana river, (present Spercheios) in Greece. It may also be a reference to the Alemanni.															||
||Vilayet Sea						||Geographically, the Caspian Sea. The name comes from vilayet, the term for administrative regions in the Ottoman Empire.	||
||Zhaibar Pass						||The Khyber Pass which has been the traditional borderline between Afghanistan and Pakistan.														||
||Zaporoska River				||The Dnieper river and/or the Don and/or the Volga. The river's name was probably influenced by Zaporizhian Sich, a settlement of the Ukrainian Cossacks in Zaporizhzhia (region). It was situated on the Dnieper river, below the Dnieper rapids (porohy, poroz.a), hence the name, translated as "territory beyond the rapids".	||
