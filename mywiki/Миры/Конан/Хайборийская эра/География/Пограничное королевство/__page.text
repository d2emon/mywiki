Border Kingdom

Ганзейский союз

Geographically located over the modern German Baltic Sea coast. A lawless region full of savages. Conan once traveled through the Border Kingdoms on his way to Nemedia. He befriended Mar the Piper and the King of the Border Kingdoms. He helped save the kingdoms before returning to his quest in reaching Nemedia.

A bleak and blasted strip of land, the Border Kingdom is governed by a gallery of warlords, each claiming a small region of the country. Largely uninhabited and inhospitable.
