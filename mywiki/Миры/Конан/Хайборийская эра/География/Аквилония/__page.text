Aquilonia

Империя Карла Великого, Римская Империя

A cross between the Roman Empire and Carolingian Empire. The name is borrowed from Aquilonia, a city of Southern Italy, between modern Venosa and Benevento; it is also an ancient name of Quimper and resembles that of Aquitaine, a French region ruled by England for a long portion of the Middle Ages. The name is derived from Latin aquilo(n–), "north wind". In Italian, aquila means also "eagle" that is the sign used in war by Roman Legion as well as the Aquilonian army.

The Hyborian World's preeminent kingdom, Aquilonia is the greatest economic and military power west of the Vilayet Sea. Destined one day to have Conan for its king.
