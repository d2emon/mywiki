!! Khoraja

Constantinople and the Etruscans and possibly the associated Principality of Antioch, County of Edessa, and County of Tripoli, collectively known as Outremer. The name itself was inspired by the references of Sax Rohmer to the fictional city of Khorassa in the novel The Mask of Fu Manchu.
