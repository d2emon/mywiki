!! Yamatai

Japan. Probably inspired by the historical name of Yamatai. The land of Yamatai is described as "a cluster of islands east of Khitai", ruled by the "Witch Queen of Yamatai" in the omonymous The Savage Sword of Conan story, herself possibly inspired by the historical shaman-queen Himiko.

NOTE: Yamatai is not an original Hyborian Age country.
