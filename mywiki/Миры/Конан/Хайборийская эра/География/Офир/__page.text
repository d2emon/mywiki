Ophir

Библейский Офир, отчасти Италия

Ancient Ophir, a gold-mining region in the Old Testament, possibly on the shores of the Red Sea or the Arabian Sea (e.g. western Arabia), though clearly Howard saw it as situated somewhere in Italy.

Glittering Ophir is home to numerous gold mines, making it the wealthiest kingdom of the Hyborian World. It is a land of rolling meadows dotted with forests and bordered by mountains to the north and east. Ophireans are known for their generosity and the strength of their army.
