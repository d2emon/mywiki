Persian name for Turkestan. A Turkish land, possibly referring to the Gokturk Empire, the Timurid Empire, or the Seljuk Empire. The name derives from Turan, the areas of Eurasia occupied by speakers of Ural–Altaic languages. The names of the various Turanian cities (e.g. Aghrapur, Sultanapur, Shahpur) are often in Persian language. King Yezdigerd is named after Yazdegerd III, ruler of the Sassanid Empire.[l] The city of Khawarizm takes its name from Khwarezm, and Khorusun from Khorasan.

Prosperous despite its inhospitable terrain, Turan lies in the path of busy trade routes, both overland and seagoing. Its highly developed military system combined with its imperialistic policies make it a constant threat to its neighbors.
