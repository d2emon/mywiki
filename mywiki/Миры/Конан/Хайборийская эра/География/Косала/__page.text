Kosala

Древнеиндийское королевство Кошала

From the ancient Indo-Aryan kingdom of Kosala, corresponding roughly in area with the region of Oudh.

Westernmost vassal state of Vendhya, Kosala is a semi-arid plateau marked with rocky hillocks. Residents of each city-state within Kosala adhere fanatically to their own distinct religious code, and contact with outsiders is limited.
