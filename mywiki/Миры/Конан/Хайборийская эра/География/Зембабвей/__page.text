Zembabwei

Великое Зимбабве

The Munhumutapa Empire. The name comes from Great Zimbabwe, a ruined fortified town in Rhodesia, first built around the 11th century and used as the capital of the Munhumutapa Empire. Oddly, this is the same root as the modern name for the Republic of Zimbabwe.	

Zembabwei, remotest of the Black Kingdoms, is primarily jungle with broad grasslands at its southern reaches. It is a largely isolated society ruled by twin kings, who maintain order with an air force of cavalrymen astride giant trained birds.
