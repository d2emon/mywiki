An eastern land corresponding to modern Iran. Historically, the name of the country is derived from the Iran + the Persian istan, estan, "country".

An arid, rocky land, Iranistan is home to various desert tribes who govern in a tenuous confederacy. It is the avenue of some caravan traffic, but is rarely visited by outlanders.
