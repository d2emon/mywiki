!! Pelishtim

Philistines (P'lishtim in Hebrew). The Pelishti city of Asgalun derives its name from Ashkelon. The Pelisti god Pteor or Baal-Pteor derives his name from the Moabite Baal-Peor. The philistines were relatives of the greek who invaded the mideast at the north-south- going doric migrations around 1200 BC. They are identified with "the sea peoples" who tried to invade Egypt at the same time but were repelled; i.e. in reality. Perhaps Not in Conans world.
