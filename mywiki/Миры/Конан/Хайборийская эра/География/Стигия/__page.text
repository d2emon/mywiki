Stygia

Древний Египет

Egypt. The name comes from the Styx, a river of the Greek underworld in Greek mythology. In earlier times the territory of Stygia included Shem, Ophir, Corinthia, and part of Koth. Stygia is ruled by a theocracy of sorcerer-kings. The people are dark-skinned. Most of the common people are descendants of the various races across the world. They worship the serpent god Set. Stygia's terrain is a mix of mountains, deserts, and marshes. The River Styx flows through Stygia into the sea.[j] The commoners of Stygia may still, in spirit, be the original human slaves or slave races of the serpent men who ruled this kingdom centuries before.[k] The white skinned elite may still worship "The great dark nameless one" (Skelos?).

Settled first by an ancient race of serpent people, Stygia remains tainted and damned by their unholy presence. Steeped in black magic and haunted by demons, the country is ruled by priests of the snake god Set. Foreigners avoid it.
