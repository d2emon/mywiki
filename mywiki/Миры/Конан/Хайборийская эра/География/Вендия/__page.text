Vendhya

Древняя Индия

India (the Vindhya Range is a range of hills in central India). The name means "rent" or "ragged", i.e. having many passes. This very ancient kingdom worships the god Asura.[m] This cult has spread westwards and is present, albeit often persecuted, in the Hyborian lands. In Aquilonia, the cult finds a protector in King Conan.

Enigmatic Vendhya, veiled from outsiders by the towering Himelian Mountains, is an ancient land of powerful deities and glittering treasures. It is a fertile, tropical paradise rich in natural resources, and its people produce some of the world's finest art.
