!! Пиктские дебри

Pictish Wilderness

Доримские Британские острова, пикты, Индейцы Северной Америки

Pre-Columbian America, with an overlay of North America during the European colonization of the Americas, possibly even colonial-era New York. Howard bestows names from the Iroquoi language on many of his Hyborian-Age Picts (but not the quasi-historical Picts featuring Bran Mak Morn).

Pictland is home to various distinct tribes of Stone Age primitives possessed of feral fighting ability and strong natural magic. The Picts' frequent raids terrorize their Aquilonian neighbors.
