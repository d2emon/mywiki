Zingara

Испания и Португалия

Spain/Portugal. Iberian Peninsula as a whole. Zingara is also Italian for "Gypsy woman"; this may mean that Howard mixed up the source names of Zingara and Zamora, with Zingara originally meant to apply to the Roma kingdom, and Zamora to the Spanish kingdom.

Chief naval power of the Western Sea, Zingara virtually monopolizes the lucrative shipping lanes between the Pictish forests and the markets of Kush. It is a proud society, culturally and scientifically advanced.
