Монголия времён Хубилая, Кочевники Великой Степи

Eurasian Steppe. Hyrkania, in classical geography, was a region southeast of the Caspian Sea or Hyrkanian Sea corresponding to the Iranian provinces of Golestan, Mazandaran, and Gilan. The name is Greek for the Old Persian Varkana, one of the Achaemenid Empire satrapies, and survives in the name of the river Gorgan. The original meaning may have been "wolf land". In Iranian legend, Hyrkania is remarkable for its wizards, demons, wolves, spirits, witches, and vampires.

Hyrkania is a vast and rolling prairie nation controlled by a loose affiliation of family groups. Its people are nomads, the finest horsemen and archers in the world. The famed adventuress Red Sonja is a Hyrkanian native.
