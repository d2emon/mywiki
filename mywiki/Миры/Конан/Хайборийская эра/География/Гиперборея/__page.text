Hyperborea

Финляндия, Россия, Прибалтика

Finland, Russia, and the Baltic countries (Hyperborea). Is a land in the "outermost north" according to Greek historian Herodotus. Howard describes his Hyperborea as the first Hyborian kingdom, "which had its beginning in a crude fortress of boulders heaped to repel tribal attack".

A sinister empire cloaked in a perpetual icy fog, Hyperborea is ruled by powerful magic users. Insular and mysterious, Hyperborean society is closed to all but the most unfortunate of travelers.
