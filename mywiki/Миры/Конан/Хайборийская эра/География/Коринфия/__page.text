Corinthia

Венгрия

Ancient Greece. From Corinth (Korinthos), a rich city in Classical Greece. Possibly suggested to Howard by the Epistles to the Corinthians, or by the region of Carinthia.

A vestige of the ancient, cursed kingdom of Acheron, Corinthia is a minor power nestled against the jagged Karpash Mountains, with an interior of grassy steppes.
