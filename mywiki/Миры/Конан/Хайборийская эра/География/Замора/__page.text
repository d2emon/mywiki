Zamora

Крымское ханство, цыгане, Армения

The Romani people. The name comes from the city of Zamora, Zamora province, Castile-León, Spain, alluding to the Gitanos of Spain (see Zingara for discussion); or possibly it is based on the word "Roma". There may also be some reference to southern Italy, as Zamorans dance the tarantella in honor of their Spider-Gods (variously known as Omm and Zath). Also hints of Ancient Israel and Palestine.

An arid plain nestled between the Karpash Mountains to the west and the Kezankians to the east, Zamora is an important waystation on the great trade routes. Its culture is steeped in mystery, and the darkened alleys and illicit allure of its cities has been the death of many an unfortunate traveler.
