Nemedia

Священная Римская империя

A cross between Rome and Byzantium. Nemedia is the rival of Aquilonia (which corresponds to the Carolingians), and depended on Aesir mercenaries for their defence (as the Byzantine Empire hired Vikings as the Varangian Guard). The name comes from Nemed, leader of colonists from Scythia to Ireland in Irish mythology.

An ancient and powerful player on the political landscape of the Hyborian World, Nemedia is known as a center of scholarly learning and religious diversity. It comprises fertile farmland bordered by mountains to the south and west.
