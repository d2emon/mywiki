Dark Age Scandinavia. Vanaheim is the home of the Vanir in Norse mythology. The red-haired vanir will finally oust the evil aristocracy of Stygia and found pharaonic Egypt. They are red-haired because an old Egyptian legend mentions that Egypt was founded by "red haired" strangers from outside.	

The western half of Nordheim. Vanaheim is a harsh and wintry place populated by fearsome warriors divided along tribal lines. Its people, the Vanir, harbor long-standing feuds with their Жsir neighbors to the east and the Cimmerians to the south.
