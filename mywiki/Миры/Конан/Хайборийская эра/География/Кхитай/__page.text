Khitai

Китай

China. The name is derived from the Khitan Empire (Chinese Liáo cháo or the Liao Dynasty) and the people who ruled northern and northeastern China. The name is derived from the Khitan language for The Khitan Empire, Mos diau-d kitai huldʒi gur; in modern Mandarin Chinese, Qìdān guó.[e] In the Hyborian age, Khitai is an ancient empire which is always at war with Kambuja to the south. In ancient times, Khitai was subjugated by an empire of conquerors from a mysterious continent in the eastern ocean. After the cataclysm, this empire made slaves of the Lemurians who fled the destruction. With time the Lemurian slaves, and perhaps the gentile Khitanians, were able to rise and topple this emprire.[f] The remnants of this white-skinned master race fled westwards, conquering the land of the serpentmen and founding Stygia. The people of Khitai are yellow-skinned and of medium height. Khitai is ruled by a God-Emperor whose decisions are greatly influenced by the Scarlet Circle, a clan of some of the most powerful mage lords in all of Hyboria. Khitan laws flow from the overlord of a city-state. The culture of Khitai is similar to that of ancient China. The most prominent feature of Khitai is its Great Wall (similar to the Great Wall of China), which protects it from foreign invasions from the north. The cities of Khitai are Ruo-Chen, Shu-Chen, Shaulum, and the capital, Paikang, which contains the Jade Citadel, from which the God-Emperor rules over all of Khitai.

Khitai is the mysterious Orient of the Hyborian World. It is a land of elaborate rituals and venerable magic, ruled by warlords who frequently fall to treachery and intrigue.
