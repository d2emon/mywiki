Brythunia

Речь Посполитая

The continental homelands of the Angles and Saxons who invaded Great Britain, which is the origin of the name. Semantically, the name Brythunia is from the Welsh Brython, "Briton", derived from the same root as the Latin Brito, Britannia, although Howard stated that the name was kept by the Æsir and Nemedians who settled there. The land is depicted geographically over modern Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia.

Relatively weak in the Hyborian pecking order, Brythunia is a cold and desolate place marked by the barren highlands of the northeast and the wide prairies and damp forested areas of the central region.
