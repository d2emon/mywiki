Howard states in The Hyborian Age that "the Gaels, ancestors of the Irish and Highland Scots, descended from pure-blooded Cimmerian clans." He correlates Cimmeria with the Cymric people, Cimbri, Gimirrai, Scythians, Cimmerians, and the Crimea. Geographically located over modern Ireland, Scotland, and England.[c] The name is derived from the Greek legends of a northern people, who lived in perpetual mist and darkness near the Land of the Dead.

Birthplace of Conan, Cimmeria is a somber and foreboding landscape of craggy peaks and sharp crevasses. Its people are organized in small clan units, and though they frequently feud amongst themselves, they'll band together to face any foreign invader.
