Koth

Византия, Хеттское Царство

From the ancient Hittites (the name Koth may come from the fact that the Hittites are called in the Bible the children of Heth, and the Egyptians called their land Kheta). The Kothian capital of Khorshemish corresponds to Carchemish, capital of a Neo-Hittite kingdom. Perhaps from The Sign of Koth in The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath by H. P. Lovecraft.[g] Howard also used the same name in his interplanetary novel Almuric.

For millennia, its rugged highlands have played host to caravans from every corner of the world, and Koth remains an important factor in Western trade and politics. Its religion has roots in evil Acheron, making Koth rife with dark forces.
