!! The Fourth / Thurian / Pre-cataclysmic age

!!! 1 (38,610 B.C.)

* First year of the Fourth Age.

!!! 61 (38,549 B.C.)

* Death of Rose Gamgee, Sam's wife (born Rose Cotton). Samwise Gamgee delivers the red book into the hands of Elanor, and passes into the West.

!!! 120 (38490 B.C.)

* Death of Aragorn II Elessar (Envinyatar, Telcontar), and Ascendance to the throne of the Reunited Kingdom of his son Eldarion.

!!! 121 (38489 B.C.) 

* Death of Arwen Undomiel, queen of the Reunited Kingdom..

!!! 38,000 B.C.

* Riss-Urm/Eem/Sangamon Interglacial Age truly sets in.
* The oldest image of a star pattern, that of the famous constellation of Orion, has been recognised on an ivory tablet as between 32,500 and 38,000 years old. The tiny sliver of mammoth tusk contains a carving of a man-like figure with arms and legs outstretched in the same pose as the stars of Orion. Believed to have been left behind by the mysterious Aurignacian people who moved into Europe from the east supplanting the indigenous Neanderthals.
35,700 B.C.
* The vampiress Akivasha : "The name of that ancient, evil, beautiful princess still lived the world over in song and legend, though ten thousand years had rolled their cycles since the daughter of Tuthamon had reveled in purple feasts amid the black halls of ancient Luxor".
* Obviously Luxor---later part of Stygia---was founded before that time---in my view, by Black Numenoreans fleeing Gondor. Note that the only earlier vampire on record was mentioned in the Lay of Lithien.

!!! 33, 700 B.C.

* King Kull reigns in Valusia.
* The waning of the civilization of the main, or Thurian continent... a civilization dominated by the kingdoms of Ramelia, Valusia, Verulia, Grondar, Thule and Commoria. These people spoke a similar language, suggesting a common origin. (Westron, in my view. Howard's words, my italics. "Valka", the name of the greatest god of that time, seems to be taken from Quenya root words which mean "power-bright", although they are put together oddly. It may be a later name for Eru. "Grondar", of course, suggests "Gondor", although they seem to be the least of the kingdoms, perhaps asserting a variation of the old name to reclaim old glories.) Though they don't seem to be in agreement. The barbarians of the age were the Picts, who lived on islands far out on the Western Ocean, the Atlanteans, who dwelt on a small continent between the Pictish islands and the Thurian continent, and the Lemurians, who inhabited a chain of large islands in the Eastern Hemisphere. There were vast regions of unexplored land, the civilized kingdoms, though enormous, occupied a relatively small portion of the whole planet.
* (I've put a gap of 500 years here, because evidently the island-nation called Atlantis by Howard, which was barbaric at this time, possibly named in memory of Numenor, or Atlantte, had become more civilized, and had colonies on the mainland when the Great Cataclysm hit.)

!!! 33,200 B.C.

* Then the Cataclysm rocked the world. (There have been suggestions of a cometary impact---see http://www.rehupa.com/rippke_cataclysm.htm by Dale Rippke) Atlantis and Lemuria sank, and the Pictish Islands were heaved up to form the mountain peaks of a new continent. Sections of the Thurian Continent vanished under the waves, or sinking, formed great inland lakes and seas. Volcanoes broke forth and terrific earthquakes shook down the shining cities of the empires. Whole nations were blotted out.
