!! From the First to the Hyborian Age:

a combined Tolkien/Robert E. Howard timeline

There are two major texts, at least, that deal with civilizations that existed in what today's anthropologists call prehistory: one is the Red Book of Westmarch, on which Professor Tolkien based his LORD OF THE RINGS. The other is the Nemedian Chronicles, which deals both with the "Pre-Cataclysmic" age and the Hyborian Age, on which Robert E. Howard based his Kull and Conan stories. Looking into real prehistory, about the only place you can fit the over seven thousand years of Tolkien's history and eight thousand years of Howard's history, and have Cro-Magnon man functioning in a non-glacial environment, is in the relatively warm period of 50,000 to 25,000 years ago. Besides, as you'll see below, there is good reason, taking Tolkien at his word, to date the "awakening of the elves" as when the Big Dipper/Great Bear formed. Certainly, it is one of the few events that can be dated to our timelines.
I've divided the chronology into five ages, but you can see some notes below. You'll notice in the chronology I include some markers from "real" prehistory.

Why do the archeologists dig up no artifacts from the Hyborian, Fourth/Thurian/Pre-Cataclysmic, Third, Second, or even First Ages? Well, some of the structures are five to ten times older than the Sphynx or the Pyramids, which are showing signs of wear and tear. Natural erosion and rust would account for some of it. Also, we have reason to believe that cultists of the entities H.P. Lovecraft described may have already raised such caches. Certainly the "Starry Wisdom" cult got the "Shining Trapezedon" which had passed through the hands of the serpent-men of Valusia, among others, according to the account of the late Robert Blake. Doubtless such cultists repeatedly mined and looked for caches of such artifacts long before modern archeology got off the ground. They would have destroyed remaining caches to keep rival cultists from getting hold of "mystical" objects once they were through with it...and over centuries, eventually destroyed traces of these earlier civilizations. (They would have no real way to distinguish objects from, say, Kull's time than from Isildur's time, and destroyed them all.)

Many researchers have contributed to these conclusions...I would like to especially like to thank Dale Rippke, Alberto Monteiro, and Cheryl Lynx, whose research has helped immensely. Many others, too numerous to mention, have contributed in part.


!!! First/Second/Third Ages

Preliminary timeline on the earliest ages in Tolkien, with actual dates to one side. Since Valarian years are 9.582 solar years, I made adjustments for that (see MORGOTH'S RING). Only major events are mentioned. (No, I don't know what the "creation" of the Sun and Moon means in this context. I think the Valar are extra-universal beings sent to help foster the creation of the "children of Illuvatur", Elves and humans. That they didn't shape Earth, but prepared it for the coming of full functioning hominids, like Cro-Magnon man. It's possible that Morgoth got there first and blocked the sun with some sort of screen, at least in the visible spectrum, which may have triggered another glaciation, although the heat and ultra-violet light did go through. The Valar, having no reference to compare it to, didn't recognize his stratagem till the death of the Two Trees, and the Maiar they sent aloft actually destroyed the "screen" between Earth and the visible Sun and Moon.)
The date for the awakening of the Elves is when the Great Bear was first observed in its current form, which Tolkien said when Varda/Elbereth kindled several new constellations, including the Great Bear. Everything else more or less flows from that, but doubtless the dates could be moved by several centuries or even several thousand years either way without much harm.

According to a site I found, the Big Dipper/Great Bear first was observed in its present form around 50,000 B.C.

"The seven are not moving in the same direction, and over time the asterism will dissolve. In fact, it is only the last 50,000 years or so that a discernible "dipper" has formed. As the stars move their separate ways, the shape will more and more become plough-like, with the pointer star (alpha Ursae Majoris) moving in front of the rest, and somewhat south of its present position."

For the Valacirca, the Sickle of the Valar, was the same as the Great Bear/Great Dipper. Varda put it in the sky in my original edition of the Silmarillion, on page 48, and Beren makes a song in praise of it on page 174.

It was said as Varda ended her labors, and put those constellations in the sky, the Elves awoke....

!!! The Fourth/Thurian/Pre-Cataclysmic Age

A lot of the dating on THIS one is dependent on the dating of the age after this. (The Hyborian Age.) It doesn't have a LOT of information in it---we know a lot about the beginning of the Fourth AGe, and a lot towards the end (King Kull and Valusia) and practically nothing inbetween, save for one reference in HOUR OF THE DRAGON/CONAN THE CONQUEROR. Certainly there is room---especially since Howard said the civilized areas were a relatively small amount of the continent---for other things to be happening, in a more traditional Stone Age setting. It may be that, for instance, the Earth's Children series by Jean Auel (CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR, etc.), or William Golding's INHERITORS either happened in the "hinterlands" while King Kull was ruling Valusia, or in the few thousand years of total savagery after the Great Cataclysm in the early Hyborian Age.

Of course, I had to move Kull back in time from the "traditional" time of 20,000 A.D., since, that would put the City of Wonders smack-dab in the worst part of an Ice Age. And Howard DID say the "glacial ages started" (actually, the recurrence of the last phase of the last glacial age) as the Hyborian Age ended. So I have textural reference for dating these so.

Still...when you got used to a scholar like Tolkien, it's rather eye-opening to go from the involved chronologies and appendixes of Tolkien to the more slapdash style of a professional fiction writer like Howard.

The easternmost of the "Seven Empires" that Valusia competed with was called---Grondar. Could Grondar be a later version of the kingdom Tolkien called--Gondor? Linguistic shift over centuries could account for the shift from "Gon" to "Gron", and from "Dor" to "Dar", relatively minor changes? Gondor could have expanded east, completely occupying the lands once known as Mordor...

Do we see any other signs of Tolkien's cultures in the later stories of King Kull? I think we see at least linguistic clues, clues Tolkien would appreciate. Valusia, the country King Kull usurped, seems to be composed of two Quenya words. "Val" means power, as in the Valar. Although there's no "usia", there IS an "os" which means fortress. Save for Kull's home isles and the Pitish isles, it's the westernmost of the lands on the "Thurian" continent, the one facing where the blessed land of the Valar is. How fitting, then, to call it "Valos"---Power Fortress---and to have it corrupted, over centuries, to the name "Valusia".

And almost all the cultures of the pre-Cataclysmic age swore by Valka, a ---fertility?---god, but one which seems all-powerful, although some other gods were mentioned. Again, "Val" means power in Quenya, and "Ca" or "Ka" or "Kal", although more often used as a prefix, not a suffix, meant "bright". If Valka wasn't explicitedly a male god, we might think Valka is another name for Varda, Elbereth, the Star-Queen of the Valar. More likely it's another word for Eru, the One who created the Valar. Even a barbarian like Kull, not raised by the Thurian culture, swore by him, as did his friend Brule of the Pictish Isles.

Trolls in the days of Tolkien's stories were twice the size of men, immensely strong, and has green scales like armour, but extremely dim-witted. In the days of the War of the Ring, Sauron introduced the Olog-Hai, huge trolls with the intelligence of evil men who could resist the sun. When Sauron fell, most of the Olog-Hai wandered away, their bestial intelligence returning. But what if the trolls were bred for size and dull-wittedness from the serpent-men mentioned by Howard? The serpent-men of Valusia, whom Kull fought, were green-skinned and scaled, and are named as part of the Cthulhu mythos by Lovecraft, not just Howard. Valusia is near where the Shire was, once, albeit a little South. I suspect, as I mentioned in an earlier post, that the Valar opened a gateway to another world for the hobbits to live, free of being harrassed by men....the land Dorothy Gale entered. (The Quadlings, Winkies, Munchkins, etc. may be distant descendents of the hobbits. Note they are also "halflings"---the size of a child when full grown.) Perhaps the Ents and the Huorns (the Tin Woodman fought some talking trees who were very like Huorns) and the intelligent eagles also might have migrated into the land that would be later known as Oz, to make way for the growing ranks of men. The diminished, newly-intelligent Trolls/serpent-men might have enslaved the humans of Valusia until they finally rose and revolted, and hence the proud name of "Power Fortress", Valos, later Valusia.

What about Lemuria, Mu and Atlantis? While I don't doubt there were island kingdoms of that time, those names are from a variety of occult and ancient sources. I suspect their true names were something different, and Howard changed them to more familiar names for most readers.

By Kull's time, the empires such as Valusia and Grondar are decadent, effete remnents of a once mighty people.....Grondar is called "less cultured" than her sister empires, with Valusia perhaps originally being a subject kingdom where many of the more cultured migrated to. Or perhaps the influx and absorption of other peoples, caused them to eventually rename their land, after "Grond", the Hammer of the Underworld that Morgoth wielded. I think it more likely, though, that this is the sad remains of Gondor, both linguistically and literally. (It may be that Gondor, like the Roman Empire, split into two halves, and the eastern half became Grondar, and the other split into smaller empires, as happened to the Western Roman Empire.)

I think the "prehuman race" like the resurrected sorcerer in HOUR OF THE DRAGON mentioned by Howard are actually Black Numenoreans. They are learned in sorcery, tall, pale, many characteristics shared by the Mouth of Sauron. (He didn't have glowing eyes, unlike Howard's examples, but his horse did---maybe a side effect of his knowledge of sorcery?) Since they are Numenoreans, they could easily be descended from Elros, who was half-elven. Later ages called them the "Eldar Race", a name usually reserved for the elves, which refers to traces of their elven blood. I also think the pre-Stygian race in Luxor are part of the same race, including the vampiress mentioned below.

!!! The Hyborian Age

Okay, this is the Howard-only one---and let me say, trying to work out a consistent chronology from Howard's "The Hyborian Age" is NOT an easy job. I got about three or four different totals every time I tried. Luckily, we knew from CONAN THE CONQUEROR/HOUR OF THE DRAGON that Acheron fell 3000 years before Conan, and had been around for 2500 years. And we knew the Lemurians had been held captive by the people who moved into Stygia/Acheron for at least two thousand years before THAT. So that gives us 7500 years, at least, between the Great Cataclysm and Conan. So the traditional 8000 years between Kull and Conan looks good...because other researchers, even the reknowned DAle Rippke in "The Mystery of Pre-Human Stygia" at http://www.rehupa.com/rippke_stygia.htm have come up with other totals, like, 6500 years.

I also want to bring up a rather odd peculiarity of ALL these ancient texts and maps. We expect some lousy maps (just look at some medieval maps) but all of them make a glaring omission. All of them leave out the Mediterranean, but the Mediterranean has been around for the last ten million years. Tolkien does it. Howard does it, both in map and text. So what's going on?

I suggest--as a provisional theory---that there is something either holy or extremely feared about the Mediterranean before 25,000 B.C. The avoiding of mentioning something that is OBVIOUSLY there---there must have been times when Conan had to cross the Mediterranean to get where he's going---strikes me as religious, on a par with a Muslim refusing to see the Prophet depicted in a movie or picture, or the early Greek Orthodox Christians choosing not to use relistic images of people, on the "thou shalt make no graven image" idea. Perhaps the Mediterranean was holy to the Mother Goddess, the "fat broad" (as an archeology professor of mine called her) whose image is scattered throughout prehistoric Europe. That even the mention of crossing it, or the depiction of it in maps, was forbidden. (Maybe mentioning the Mother Goddess in text was forbidden also, which is why we have no mention of her in Tolkien OR Howard.....unless Yavanna is meant to be depicted.)

That's just a guess. I don't think Conan was a particularly religious man (except about Crom) but whoever wrote the Nemedian Chronicles might have been---or afraid of being stoned/burned at the stake or whatever they did back then.

Anyway, the Hyborian Age might be called the Fifth Age in Tolkien's worldview.

(:childlist:)

This is how the dating of "The Hyborian Age" seems to me: dates are from the Cataclysm, numbers in square brackets are page refs to The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian.

* Pre-Cataclysmic Age [381–2]
* 0: Cataclysm: Atlantis and Lemuria sink, Pictish Islands heaved up. Continental Picts and Atlanteans survive. Lemurians escape to eastern coast of Thurian Continent, enslaved by the ancient race there. Proto-Hyborians flee north, drive the snow-apes north. [382–3]
* 500: Pictish–Atlantean wars end. Lesser cataclysm; creates inland sea. [382–3]
* 1000: Acheron founded by the children of the Giant-Kings.
* 1500: Lemurians have risen and destroyed their masters, who came west, overthrew the giant-kings, founded the "human" kingdom of Stygia. Hyborians have spread over the north; begin to drift southward [383–4] 
* 2000: Hyborians sweep south. Descendants of Zhemri revive. Sons of Shem wander east of Stygia. Agriculture evolved in valley of Zingg. Hyperborea has come into being. [384–5]
* 2000–3000: Rise of the Hyborian kingdoms. Koth founded. Zamora founded. Zingara founded after influx of Picts then Hybori. [385]
** 2000-2500: Zamora founded. Stygia expands into the lands settled by the Shemites, and lays claim to the lands east of the growing empire of Acheron. Zingara's aboriginal inhabitants absorbed by a Pictish influx. 
** 2500–3000: Hyborian tribes settle in the lands under Stygian rule. Hyborian tribes settle the strip of land that exists between Acheron and the Pictish and Cimmerian wilderness. The first Hyborian nations (Koth, Ophir, and Corinthia) are founded, but remain under Stygia's domination. Zingara founded after a tribe of Hybori conquer and absorb the region's inhabitants. [385] 
* 3000–3500: Koth, Ophir and Corinthia successfully rebel against Stygia and sack Kuthchemes. The nation of Acheron falls under the combined weight of a Hyborian invasion. Aquilonia, Nemedia, Argos and Brythunia are founded. Koth flexs its might and drives the Stygians south of the Styx. [385–6] 
* 3500: The kingdoms of the world are defined: the Hyborian kingdoms, Zamora, Zingara, Stygia, Cimmeria, Picts [385–6]
* 3500–4000: Æsir and Vanir in Nordheim. Lemurians emerge as Hyrkanians, establish Turan. [386]
* 4000: Hyborian civilization enters its height (Conan stories) [386–7]
* 5000: Kothic adventurers carve the small kingdoms of Khauran and Khoraja out of the Shemitish lands to the southeast of Koth
* 6000(approx) Conan becomes King of Aquilonia.
* 6500: Fall of Hyborian civilization [387–97] 


* 38,000 B.C. = The Great Cataclysm

* 32,500 B.C. = The reign of king Conan
* 31,900 B.C. = The death of Gorm, Hyborian Age ends
