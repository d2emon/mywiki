!! Ludum Dare

!!! Preparing Pre-LD:

* Get your chores and any tasks that are on your mind done and out of the way.
* Test out your tools and do any updates that are needed to avoid extra down time
* Brain storm on what your limits are and use those as a guide once the theme is released
* Clean up your work space, get a pen and paper.

!!! During LD:

* Plan out your time even if it’s just super general
* Unless you feel super confident do not make huge changes to your game on the last stretch of the compo or jam. As is the custom, KISS(keep it simple stupid).
* Take breaks, whether it be an hour walk or 5 minutes of petting your dog or cat. Often times your mind will still be thinking of your game and you may come up with something new and amazing.
* (Opinion!) Make time for at least adding a background sound track or some sound effects AND a menu. It doesn’t matter if your game menu is just a play and exit button, if the player has to ctrl+alt+delete or alt+F4 your game it feels unfinished. Additionally, sound even a little can add a lot.
* Have fun.
* Make a reminder or alarm for key time points during the compo or jam. It is good to know how much time you have left and when to stop adding more and more features.

!!! Post LD:

* Share! A common thing to do once you wrap up is to write your after thoughts, what you did well, what you sucked at, and your thoughts on it.
* Unwind and play some games, preferably ones your fellow ludum dare enthusiasts have made. Remember to leave comments, because you know that thrill you get when you see a new comment? Other people can experience that too!
* If you enjoyed your game, keep working on it. Many games have become full releases that started out as compo or jam entries.
* Learn from the community that keeps coming back. One of the biggest gems of ludum dare is that it is a smorgasbord of talent and creative new ideas.
